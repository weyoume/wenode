# Abstract:

We believe that Social media should be designed to serve a positive purpose. WeYouMe enables users to have more control over their data, and use a single blockchain account to access any application on the network. The network democratises the community guidelines for content moderation, and enables a truly neutral public square. 

WeYouMe will enable everyone to share information and value freely. 
Users can share any type of content with their friends, peers, and the world by making posts to the WeYouMe blockchain. It will be free to use, open source, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant. The network will reward users for posting content, voting on content, and contributing resources.

The WeYouMe Mobile Application is a simple micro-blogging platform, that packs a suite of advanced cryptocurrency features. It enables users to create posts to connect with their audience, message their friends, and earn cryptocurrency rewards for sharing valuable content.

The WeYouMe blockchain protocol enables seamless and trustless interaction between users and businesses. It uses a graphene based blockchain to store consensus state information, and uses cryptocurrency rewards to incentivise positive user activity.

The WeYouMe team will launch the WeYouMe Mainnet blockchain, and will create an ecosystem of cross platform compatible and open source applications that operate on the protocol. A WeYouMe account will give users a digital identity that they have complete control over. Users can post with their full digital reputation behind them, as an independent persona. It will offer a comprehensive digital currency wallet and trading platform, with a decentralized and open market of digital assets, services, and products.

WeYouMe will operate on a global distributed node network, with no central point of failure. All content files are first encrypted, and can either be stored permanently and immutably on IPFS across the entire world, or completely deleted and inaccessible after a specified time period. Private messages are encrypted, and are relayed by network Supernodes.

WeYouMe gives a voice to everyone by sorting content and electing leaders according to user votes. Optional monthly subscriptions, advertising, and trading fees earn revenue for stakeholders.

# The Problem

- Social media companies face rising issues around putting profit before people.

- As content creators, We usually do not earn any income for our contributions, and are not in control of our content distribution.

- As users, We have limited control and ownership over our personal information, or how it is used by advertising targeting algorithms.

- Content moderation systems are unable to cope with the volume and complexity of human communication.

- Social media businesses have misaligned incentives, and earn from creating conflict, rather than community.

# The Solution

- The future of social media should be designed to serve a positive purpose.

- WeYouMe redesigns social media architecture to put You at the center, and create value, rather than extract it.

- WeYouMe introduces content creator tools to drive the evolution of social media.

- WeYouMe uses crowdsourced moderation to meet the challenges of our complex social landscape.

- WeYouMe offers a simple integrated exchange experience that just works.

# 1. Context:

Mainstream social media platforms enable free access to a global communications network of unprecedented scale. However, they collect vast quantities of private data, and retain ownership and control over it. They utilize advertising targeting algorithms, based on private information, without any user revenue sharing. Users are not social media customers; they are the product to be sold.

Popular content aggregators offer high quality community curated content to users. Separated user created communities offer a sense of identity and culture to groups, but they are prone to being unfairly treated by moderators, with little to no recourse from their users.

Centralized Digital platforms are susceptible to Data breaches. Their operating servers are vulnerable to being shut down and their fiat financial services can be cut off with no recourse.

Cryptocurrency offers a revolutionary new basis upon which to build economies. It allows permissionless transactions of sound money, with rapid settlements, across any borders. Cryptocurrencies can be designed to follow any programmed consensus rules, and once these rules are in place they produce an immutable blockchain record of transaction history that is thermodynamically secured from changes over long periods of time.

Established cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have room for improvement. Long block times, expensive transaction fees, and the centralization of mining in large mining pools all loom as barriers to usage. Most importantly, many established cryptocurrencies lack a mechanism for on chain governance. They rely solely upon on the allocation of mining power to decide which consensus rules to enforce.

[Bitshares](https://www.bitshares.org) and [Steem](https://www.steem.io) introduced a delegated proof of stake consensus algorithm that allows all value holders to vote on who should produce blocks. This ability to vote on how blocks are produced does something very important. It brings decentralized governance to cryptocurrency. It also mitigates mining centralization, and allows these elected block producers to act as compensated leaders of the platform, all while being accountable to user votes on a second by second basis. Bitshares introduced the user issued asset, a cryptocurrency token that is created easily by an account, and can be traded on the blockchain as its own distinct asset using the decentralized exchange. By making blockchain transactions fast, free, and lightweight, they can be used for any user interaction, not just financial transfers.

Steem offers a new model for social media, but has some gaps in its functionality. To make order of magnitude gains over existing centralized social networks, a decentralized social network needs:

- Private Messaging
- Private Posting
- Subgrouping

Communities need their own space to have discussions separated from the rest of the site, where they can thrive and grow under moderation from their founding members.

At the present, Steem does not yet offer private posts with restricted visibility, or encrypted messages, or separated communities with post moderation. On Steem, media files must be hosted on centralized external services, requiring breakable links for embedded content, and the possibility of censorship from file hosts. Peer to peer content hosting protocols such as Storj, Sia, IPFS, and others allow for data to be held by a network of peers, while encrypted and sharded. 

A social network that intends to be profitable for investors needs to incorporate marketing systems that can deliver results to business partners and other avenues of revenue from users. Content purchasing mechanisms, such as those enabled by [Decent](https://www.decent.ch) and [Yours](https://www.yours.org) allow creators to earn directly from their viewers by purchasing premium content. Steem’s promotion system does not gain high levels of exposure because it is separated from the main viewing areas of the site, and offers advertisers very limited return when compared with buying votes from bidding bots.

The Steem content reward system has been overtaken by a significant presence of voting bid bots. These users accept payments to upvote any content creator to the front page, regardless of quality, or genuine user interest. They also present a problem when they apply arbitrary service blacklists without recourse to creators, and wield significant influence over the ordering of posts, and the distribution of content rewards.

Steem’s currency value proposition of higher voting power does not derive significant financial benefit. Memberships, built in marketplace trading, premium content purchases, and post promotion stand to offer much more value for the holders of WeYouMe cryptocurrencies and a broad base of revenue streams for the network.

WeYouMe proposes to build on the important advances of Bitshares and Steem, by offering new features and improvements to the user experience.

# 2. Introduction to WeYouMe:

WeYouMe will synthesize blockchain social media, decentralized exchange capabilities, and a peer to peer marketplace. WeYouMe’s flagship interface will be the website www.weyoume.io, which will be launched and operated by WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. and will allow users to interact with the blockchain network easily from the web. In addition, WeYouMe will also operate a mobile application. Content creators, network officers, and resource providers are compensated by the network for their contributions. Third party developers will be able to freely create applications that use the public blockchain database structure.

WeYouMe puts people first. Content uploaded to the WeYouMe network cannot be removed or altered without the uploader’s permission, and will always able to earn rewards from the network and viewers. With a variety of content posting options, you are in control of who can read your posts, and who can follow your identity. Persona, and Profile accounts allow for separated networks of connections and distinct identity control for your posts, votes and views. 

WeYouMe understands the off-platform consequences of on-platform activity. Users and Brands are protected at scale by empowering the community to self-moderate. We reward crowdsourced moderation, and facilitate powerful tools for content management to meet the challenges of our complex and multi-faceted social landscape. Interface filtering will enable users to shape their own experience and prevent the display of content that violates each user’s quality control choices. Governance accounts are able to apply tags to posts, in order to activate filtering of potentially undesirable content for their subscribers. We turn the problem of content moderation into an opportunity for global partners to provide valuable services to users, and improve response times.

WeYouMe optimizes the economic incentives to bring high quality content. By utilizing a content reward distribution system and posting system with anti-spam mechanisms integrated on-chain, the best content on WeYouMe can rise to the top. Voting repeatedly for the same authors is mitigated by reducing voting power when used on the same users. Spam, and Aggressive comments are stemmed by optionally applying a cost to comment on a post that is paid to the author. Voting bots are disempowered by allocating content rewards with views incorporated into the reward algorithm, by distributing voting power more evenly, using a semi-quadratic content reward curve, making downvoting more ubiquitous, and sorting posts with a more equitable algorithm. 

WeYouMe delivers returns directly to the network. Post promotion provides an organic way for creators to reach more viewers, innovators to promote their ideas and products, and businesses to reach more people and improve sales volume. Memberships allow users to disable advertising, and access benefits to their account across the entire WeYouMe ecosystem. Revenue from memberships and promotion is delivered back to the community through a network that reduces the supply of cryptocurrency.

WeYouMe bridges the world of cryptocurrency with the global community. By investing in blockchain compensated marketing and advocacy services from the community, WeYouMe builds a team of public ambassadors to drive vision of social with a positive purpose to all people, of all nations and all levels of technical understanding. WeYouMe will use a variety of integrated fiat currency gateway services to enable a frictionless flow of capital into the ecosystem, and will not require users to be familiar with bitcoin, exchanges, or blockchains to be able to purchase and transact with WeYouMe.

WeYouMe empowers content driven communities. Community leaders can create and moderate boards that contain content. WeYouMe allows community leaders to earn from building a thriving discussion under their watchful administration and curation. Each post that earns author rewards from the WeYouMe blockchain contributes a small percentage of its reward to the moderators of the boards that it is listed on.

WeYouMe rewards creators and curators. Public posts on the network can be voted on to receive author rewards from the blockchain. Voting power on WeYouMe can be increased without extensive long-term liquidity commitments through ownership of WYM, and optional long-term commitments are rewarded with multipliers on voting power, and reward pool payouts on vested MeCoin. Curators are rewarded according to how early they vote for content, and how much voting power they contribute.

WeYouMe blockchain ownership is represented by the WYM cryptoequity. Holders of WYM contribute to the network, and they are paid a reward that scales in value with the profit of the network. The supply of WYM is 10,000,000. Revenues and expenses are denominated by the MeCoin currency, which is produced in blocks, and is consumed by network services.
1,000,000,000 units are issued per year, and are actively consumed by multiple buy and burn mechanisms. WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. is the primary interface provider and founding team of the WeYouMe protocol, and represents its ownership with a separate share structure. The company earns from interface revenue derived from advertising and memberships.

WeYouMe brings stability to cryptocurrency. The MeUSD is a smartcoin that is pegged to the US dollar, and maintains a stable value. It is backed by 200% of its value in MeCoin collateral. This acts as a familiar medium of exchange for the network. The WeYouMe Decentralized Exchange allows all of your trades and exchange assets to be held and recorded on-chain, securing them against exchange hacks.

WeYouMe cryptocurrencies enable high performance, and are distributed fairly. Using a Delegated Proof of Stake and Proof of Work hybrid blockchain, transaction throughput is highly scalable, energy waste is minimized, and block times are only three seconds. Immutability is preserved by utilizing Nakamoto economic consensus with proof of work mining to secure the chain on a regular basis. Core cryptocurrencies MeCoin and MeUSD have no transaction fees, making them a highly viable payment method at the point of sale. 

WeYouMe builds in a powerful layer of resource providers. A network of Supernodes is integrated into the system, which are rewarded for providing consistent processing, storage, bandwidth, transaction relaying, and hosting resources. Each Supernode holds a stake in WeYouMe, and operates an active full node to process transactions and store the blockchain. 

WeYouMe allows businesses and contributors to thrive and grow. Multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets are integrated into business accounts, allowing for the seamless creation of blockchain based businesses, with linked cryptoassets. Business operators will be able to permanently and publicly list their products as blockchain objects, which can be drawn upon by third party developers for use, display, and sale on any outside interface. Marketplace sales use an escrow wallet system to mitigate disputes and ensure integrity from buyers and sellers.

WeYouMe brings the ability to create cryptoassets to everyone. Customized user issued assets are recorded securely on the blockchain. WeYouMe will offer integrated support for creating assets to represent equity in a business, assets to represent content subscriptions, and assets to represent event tickets.

WeYouMe empowers users. WeYouMe’s post viewing customization allows users to choose the ordering of posts by weighting the impact of votes, views, shares, and comments. The way that WeYouMe posts can be sorted is highly customizable, with simple pre-set options. Merged Feeds allow for the combination of multiple sorting algorithms to be used simultaneously. The featured page provides a regularly updated stream of the highest quality content from our members, and allows our contributors to gain a valuable platform to expand their audience.

WeYouMe gives you control over your identity. Posts on the WeYouMe network can be published from profile accounts, or your persona account. Profile accounts allow users to have a fully sovereign digital identity, that can be accessed by chosen connected accounts, and third-party developers for authentication with your permission. Profile data is encrypted and is completely owned and controlled by the user.

WeYouMe protects your privacy. Persona accounts allow you to separate your posts from your main profile account to restrict association with your real identity, and allow pseudonymous transactions. Persona accounts can have as little association with your profile account as desired, allowing a strong separation of identity. Trading between persona accounts allows a high level of anonymity between customers and vendors, with no need to exchange personal information beyond what is necessary. 

WeYouMe enables true data privacy. Posts can be made privately with built in network rerouting to conceal your IP address. Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, and are posted to the blockchain, where it cannot be determined who read the message, or when, eliminating metadata analysis.

WeYouMe’s executive structure is elected by users. Holders of WYM equity and MePower hold voting power that is used to decide who leads the guiding committee of WeYouMe, called the WeYouMe executive board. WeYouMe’s executives will be chosen by the network users. The roles held by the twenty acting members of the WeYouMe executive board are clearly defined and their powers are limited. All network officers and executives are accountable to voters, and provide transparent updates on their progress.

# 2.1.	The 5 Principles of WeYouMe:

These principles are intended to be the underlying foundation of the WeYouMe blockchain and guide users towards their fullest realization.

## 1. Non-Aggression:

No initiation of force, fraud or coercion should occur using WeYouMe. 
Users should actively respond against such actions with self-defense and resistance.

## 2. Community: 

Anyone may join and participate in the WeYouMe network, no barrier shall be placed preventing access to anyone. The network shall be peer to peer, and each individual user shall be the sole arbiter of their interactivity. Anybody may start and grow their own community on WeYouMe, and no group shall be excluded. We balance the spirits of collaboration and competition to drive positive outcomes, and collective and individual success. 

## 3. Decentralization:

The network infrastructure and node implementations shall remain decentralized to ensure fault tolerance, censorship resistance, neutrality, and continuity. Users shall be able to manage their own content filtering solutions. The immutability of the blockchain shall not be compromised. No transactions shall be altered or reversed after being confirmed by the overwhelming majority of the block producers. WeYouMe codebases shall be open source. We empower users to manage who can access their content and transactions using encryption of their transaction data.

## 4. Individual Freedom:

Anyone may freely post whatever content they choose. We allow all voices to be heard, and accept the responsibility of the weight that our words carry, and their consequences. Anyone may transact freely with any other user, and no censorship of transactions shall occur. We invite investment and business to take place on the WeYouMe network, free from intermediaries.

## 5. Self - Expression:

Users are invited to share their gifts, talents and creativity without restriction, editorial control, or pressures to alter their content to fit an external worldview. More speech produces better outcomes than less speech. A passive browsing experience is no substitute for a sense of participation and contribution.

# 3. WeYouMe Pty. Ltd:

The WeYouMe company will be the initial founding team for the WeYouMe blockchain and long term custodian and operator of the www.weyoume.io web interface and WeYouMe Mobile Application. Additionally, the company will fill the initial executive board of the network, and lead the development team until the project is administrated by the elected WeYouMe executive team, and development officers.

Equity holders in WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. will earn from the interface revenue derived from promoted posts and memberships paid to the network, using the primary web interface, and primary mobile application.

WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. will operate the primary fiat currency gateway exchanges of WYM.USD and WYM.AUD. Each exchange will earn from the trading fees of the volume across these exchange pairs.

The WeYouMe blockchain protocol enables seamless and trustless interaction between users and businesses. It uses the graphene blockchain model to implement objects that are created and modified in transactions to store state information. It is an economic protocol that uses cryptocurrency to incentivize positive actions that contribute to its development. The WeYouMe blockchain protocol is open source and neutral, censorship resistant, and tamper-evident. It stores the state information of all the accounts, posts, and assets that are created on it, and it separate from all applications that operate on top of it. The WeYouMe team will launch the mainnet blockchain, and will create an ecosystem of cross platform compatible and open source applications that operate on the protocol.

## 5.1.	WeYouMe Cryptoassets:

### WYM:

Symbol – WYM

Supply – 10,000,000 Fixed

WYM is the cryptoequity of the WeYouMe platform. It represents ownership of the WeYouMe blockchain protocol, and gives holders voting power and a revenue stream. 

WYM holders earn a dividend of 20% of all issued MeCoin. 

WYM voting power scales proportionately with the length of time it is held, starting at zero, and increasing by linearly by 25% per week held, until it reaches its full power. A fixed supply of 10,000,000 units will be issued, to a wide and fair distribution base. 

The total 10,000,000 units will be distributed as follows:

500,000 – Angel Community Offering:
Distributed to early community contributors and angel investors via the legacy asset EZIRA. The Angel Community offering was conducted on Bitshares. EZIRA was sold directly, distributed to active community contributors, offered for bounties, and auctioned off to community members on a weekly basis during 2018, until September 1st. Each EZIRA will be redeemed 1:1.5 with mainnet WYM up to a maximum of 500,000 total WYM.

500,000 - Pre-Seed Offering: 
WYM will be allocated to WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. equity investors proportionally to the equity holdings at the time of mainnet launch. WeYouMe Pty Ltd. Equity will be offered for private allocations. Minimum investment of $50,000. If a minimum of $250,000 is invested, a 10% bonus is applied.

1,000,000 – Seed Round Offering: 
WYM will be allocated to private investors at a rate of $3.00 USD per unit, with a minimum investment of $50,000. If a minimum of $250,000 is invested, a 10% bonus is applied. Maximum allocation of $500,000 USD per investor.

5,000,000 –  WYM Mainnet Asset Distribution:
Distributed to investors using a periodic auction distribution system. The WYM Mainnet Distribution will last for 250 intervals of 7 days. And will begin at the same time as the Alpha Mainnet Release. Each interval, 20,000 WYM will be on offer for all contributors of cryptocurrency to the offering each week. The distribution auctions will be conducted on the WeYouMe DEX and will accept all major cryptocurrencies and fiat gateway assets. At the conclusion of each period, all contributed assets will be converted to MeCoin, and purchased units of WYM will be distributed to the bidding account. 

2,000,000 – Founders Allocation: 
Distributed between project team contributors and advisors, vested for 2 years, after which it will be released gradually over the proceeding 2 years. 

250,000 – Executive Board reserve:
Held in the account “weyoume”. Income is used at the discretion of the executive board, which is elected by users. The account can be used for voting by the executive board on any poll, election or content. The WYM held cannot be spent, it acts as a perpetual funding source for the executive board by earning MeCoin rewards. 

250,000 – Community Project reserve:
Held in the account “community”. Income used to fund community projects at the discretion of Network officers in the witness, development, advocacy and marketing, and mining pools. The account can be used for voting by the officers on any poll, election or content. The WYM held cannot be spent, it acts as a perpetual funding source for community projects with MeCoin rewards. Funding is made available to community project proposals. When a proposal reaches a majority of voting support from the WeYouMe Network Officers, it is funded.

250,000 – Blockchain Sharedrop:
Each registered Bitshares and Steem user will be issued a sharedrop of WYM when they make an Alpha account. Every account can register its addresses with a signed transaction from their account proving that they own a particular address.

125,000 – Steem (Steem power)

125,000 – Bitshares (Includes Bitshares)

250,000 – Community Pioneer Distribution:
Allocated to early community members in the following proportions, to promote growth, and reward the platform’s pioneering users.

50,000 – Board Moderators: 5000 WYM allocated to the creators of the 10 most subscribed boards one year after the mainnet launch (Measured by accounts with vested balance above 1,000 MePower)

50,000 – Verified Influencers: 5000 WYM allocated to the 10 verified accounts with the highest following counts one year after mainnet launch (Measured by accounts with vested balance above 1,000 MEP)

50,000 – Business Leaders: 5000 WYM allocated to the 10 business accounts with the highest marketplace sales volume one year after mainnet launch (Sales must be validated by independent mediators as legitimate)

50,000 – Community Builders: 5000 WYM allocated to the 10 accounts with the largest amount of referred and registered accounts created one year after launch (Measured by accounts with vested balance above 1,000 MEP)

50,000 – Content Producers: 5000 WYM allocated to the 10 accounts with the highest content rewards earned one year after launch. 

### MeCoin:

Symbol – MEC

Supply – 1,000,000,000 Issued per year

MeCoin is the liquid cryptocurrency of the WeYouMe blockchain. 1,000,000,000 units are issued per year to network contributors. 

MeCoin is continually demanded and burned by incoming network revenue from seven different sources. 

MeCoin can be vested as MePower (MEP), which can be withdrawn into MeCoin over 4 weeks. MePower gives voting power for the allocation of network rewards. The amount of voting power conferred to MePower is determined by the exchange rate between WYM and MeCoin. 

Vested MePower can optionally be locked into MeBonds (MEB), which offer a bonus to their return on investment, but cannot be powered down until maturity. MeBonds provide a 50% increase to their rate of return and voting power per vesting year remaining, up to 10 years. Vesting time can be added to existing MeBonds, to keep them at a high multiplier if they are not planned to be withdrawn in the near future. 

### MeUSD:

Code – MeUSD

Supply – Issued against MeCoin Collateral

The MeUSD is the default stable smartcoin of the WeYouMe network. It is pegged by witness feeds to be redeemable for exactly $1.00 USD worth of MeCoin. MeUSD are created by locking at least 200% of the value of the smartcoin in MEC collateral. They are borrowed against the collateral locked in, and the account creates them from this process. 

Owners of MeUSD can settle them for $1.00 USD worth of MeCoin. 

They can then be sold on the DEX, with their outstanding settlement value acting as a debt against the collateral locked in to create them. The settlement process uses the average settlement value over 24 hours from witness feeds. If any MeUSD borrower’s position goes below 175% collateralization, it is automatically settled by purchasing the asset back from the exchange and closing the position. Accounts display large warnings when a position is at risk of being force settled. All WeYouMe sponsored businesses accept MeUSD for their products, and all premium content accepts MeUSD for decryption. 


### MeCredit:

Code – MCR

Supply – Issued by WeYouMe network, by approval vote.

MeCredit is a fiat cryptoasset with a standard value of 1 MeUSD. It is created at the discretion of the WeYouMe network, and the WeYouMe board of executives. 

The value of MeCredit is supported by the automatic repurchase of the asset for MeUSD by the network out of revenue. As they are a fiat asset and a debt instrument, they have a degree of credit risk exposure. Network witnesses publish an interest rate at which all balances of MeCredit earn interest in return for lending value to the executive board of WeYouMe.   

All issuance of MeCredit must be confirmed by 51% of WeYouMe voting power, the WeYouMe CEO, and CFO. By default, no MeCredit is issued, and all network revenue is used to burn MeCoin. MeCredit is used to pay executive board member salaries, and borrow funds from network investors for community or executive use in approved publicly visible reimbursements. Executive salaries are capped by witness parameters. Executive salaries and expenses are funded only upon the majority support of the network. 

## 5.2.	Block production:

WeYouMe will use a Delegated proof of stake and proof of work hybrid blockchain algorithm, inspired by the mining and witness selection algorithm of Steem. 

WeYouMe aims to improve upon the decentralization of existing Delegated proof of Stake consensus algorithms by combining it with Proof of Work as a voting mechanism. The trade off between investing in network stake is directly mutually exclusive with investment in Mining equipment, creating a system that is difficult for one party to control a majority of both.

There are 40,000,000 blocks produced per year, resulting in an average block time of 0.7884 seconds. 

Elected witnesses and top producing proof of work miners will take turns producing blocks. Each block issues 25 new MeCoin, creating a new supply of 1,000,000,000 MeCoin per year. All holders of WYM, MEP, and MEB can vote for up to 100 witnesses, which they delegate the ability to produce and sign blocks for the blockchain once per round. In blocks, witnesses and miners create distributions to the reward pools, and earn a block reward for themselves. Accounts can optionally nominate a proxy account, and mirror their votes. 60 Witnesses and 60 miners each take turns producing a block.
 
Each block production round consists of 10 sets of 5 witness officers and 5 mining officers alternate producing a block each, then a random witness produces a block, and a random miner produces a block. Blocks include all valid transactions received by the node since the last block was created, and are signed by the account of the node that created it.

### Block producer reward allocation:

- 15% - Validators: Issued to the first two-thirds plus one witnesses and miners to broadcast commitment transactions for each block generated.

- 15% - Transaction stake: Issued to the witnesses and miners proportionally to the amount of transaction stake value included in their blocks in the preceding 7 days.

- 15% - Proof of Work: Issued to the first miner that broadcasts a valid proof of work with sufficient difficulty that includes that block.

- 15% - Proof of Activity: Issued to the first witness that broadcasts a valid proof of activity that includes that block.
 
- 40% - Block producer: Issued to the creator of each individual block.

### Witnesses:

The top 50 witnesses, collectively called the WeYouMe Witness Officers, produce a block every round. 10 additional witnesses are chosen randomly from the rest of the witness pool, with higher voted witnesses being more likely to be chosen. Witnesses validate each block received to ensure that they do not create on an invalid chain. Witnesses are voted for by holders of WeYouMe voting power. To mitigate voting collusion, voters rank their preferred witnesses, and allocate a diminishing amount of voting power to each successive choice. Each successive vote down the ranking reduces in weight by 25%. Votes allocated from witness accounts to other witness accounts are reduced in value by 75%. 

Witnesses are able to produce proof of activity transactions to claim a portion of the block reward. When a user earns an activity reward, the value of their stake is added to an activity counter assigned to the witness that they have voted 1 for. Whenever a witness’s activity counter reaches the difficulty threshold, they are able to claim the proof of activity reward for all blocks since the last proof of activity was claimed. Each proof of activity references all the activity reward claiming transactions that have been directed to them as a prime witness, and the hash of all blocks since the last proof of activity. The activity stake threshold is adjusted on a 7 day rolling average to create a target of one proof per 60 minutes. 15% of each block reward is issued to the first witness that includes it in a Proof of Activity. This incentivizes witnesses to compete to have more users rank them as their first preference with a focus on active, and high-stake accounts. 

### Miners:

The top 50 Miners, collectively called the WeYouMe Mining Officers are selected to produce a block once per round. 10 additional miners are chosen from the mining pool every round randomly, with higher producing miners more likely to be chosen. Miners are ranked by the amount of blocks included in valid proofs of work submitted to the blockchain. Miners validate each block to ensure that they do not produce proofs of work on invalid chains. The mining difficulty varies with the amount of proofs of work produced in the previous 7 days, creates a target proof amount of 1 per 10 minutes for the network, and adjusts the difficulty with a 7 day rolling moving average. Each proof of work contains the hash values of all blocks generated since the last proof of work, and varies the nonce. 

The Proof of work algorithm is as follows:

    reference = X11(block_id_list + last_proof_of_work + mining_account_name + nonce)

    input = X11(reference)

    signature = ECDSAsign(input, account_private_wallet_key)

    signature_hash = X11(signature)

    notional_public_key = RecoverPublicKey(signature_hash, signature)

    proof_of_work = X11(notional_public_key + input)

The notional public key corresponds to the theoretical private key that would have signed the data “signature_hash”, and created a signature of “signature”. Miners rapidly iterate the nonce that is added into the hash of “reference” to find a valid proof of work. A valid proof of work must be lower than the target difficulty, and the value of RecoverPublicKey(input, signature) must equal the public wallet key of the specified mining_account_name. The account private key must not have been changed in the last 60 blocks.

Each block and proof of work references the most recent proof of work broadcasted. This incentivizes miners to compete to quickly validate as many blocks as they can, and hash through nonce values to generate proofs of work before other miners are able to claim them. The mining and witness rewards are divided between the individual block producers, and the producers of proofs of work to secure blocks. 40% is claimed by the miner selected to produce the block, and another 15% is allocated to the creator of the next proof of work that includes it. The longer the time has been since a valid proof of work, the higher the reward becomes. 

### Block Validation and Confirmation:

As soon as each of the top 50 Witnesses and miners receives a block, they validate it. If the block is valid, they broadcast a validation transaction stating that they have received and approve the block. When each node has received a validation transaction from more than two thirds of the Witness and Mining officers, they broadcast a commitment transaction. 

Once a block has been validated, and committed by two thirds plus one (67) of the witnesses and miners, it is considered irreversible, and no node will switch to a chain that does not contain it. The first two thirds of the witnesses and mining officers that broadcast a confirmation and commitment transaction receive a share of 15% of the block production reward, incentivizing them to compete to quickly validate and approve transactions. The validation reward is divided proportionately to the amount of MePower staked as a validation bond. When a witness or miner is proven to have signed conflicting validation transactions or an invalid block, this balance can be claimed by the first proving node that broadcasts a slashing transaction. This provides rapid transaction finality. 
If a witness or miner produces an empty block, then they are ineligible to produce in the next round, and when a witness or miner misses blocks for 10 continuous minutes, they are removed from the witness or mining reward pool, and must re-enter manually. 

In order for hardforks to occur on the WeYouMe blockchain, a new version proposal must be accepted by 75% of the Witnesses and Miners for 14 consecutive days to activate the new consensus rules. 

Transactions on the WeYouMe blockchain are rate limited according to the amount of MePower that an account holds. The total available bandwidth is divided between all accounts, and transactions are not propagated by nodes when an account has used its bandwidth allocation. Account throughput is limited according to the reserve ratio of usage to capacity. If an account reaches the limitations of its transaction throughput offered by its network stake, it can optionally add a small transaction fee to be included in the next block by a miner. The transaction fee is claimed by the first miner to include the transaction in a block, and is paid in MeCoin.

Every WeYouMe transaction references the hash of the most recent block that the node recognizes. If that block is not included in the chain, the transaction is invalid. Therefore, transactions cannot be included in versions of the chain that do not include this referenced block. This provides consensus as to the valid chain via network transactions. This enables the usage of transactions as proof of stake to validate the chain. 

15% of the Witness and Mining rewards are divided between Witnesses and Miners respectively according to the net stake weight of the transactions that they have included in their blocks in the preceding 7 days. The voting power of each account weights the stake of each transaction. This incentivizes miners and witnesses to include the maximum possible amount of valid signed transactions in their blocks. 

## 5.3.	Supernodes:

Supernodes are WeYouMe network servers that are run by members of the community and data storage businesses. Supernodes hold a full copy of the WeYouMe blockchain and strengthen the network by propagating transactions and new blocks from witnesses and miners. The blockchain is used as an immutable ledger to store public posts, content file IPFS hash references, votes, views, transactions, marketplace trades, decentralized exchange trades, and network votes. 

Supernodes host data and provide computational resources to the network in exchange for compensation. Supernodes receive a share in the Supernode reward pool, and receive a portion of the content rewards for the files that they host. Supernode storage is used to store the media files, and serve them via the decentralized [Bittorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com), [Interplanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io), and Interplanetary Naming System (IPNS) protocols. 

All files from posts, messages, audio, video, images, and applications are hosted on Supernode servers, and are referenced by the WeYouMe blockchain using the IPNS protocol to reference an IPFS file. Data is replicated for redundancy, and is served to users through API nodes. Private Data is uploaded in an encrypted state, and can only by accessed by using a decryption key. Premium posts require a payment to be made for a group of Supernodes to send the decryption key for the encrypted files. Private posts require connection or group viewing keys to decrypt files, depending on the level of restriction. Private post files are only sent to nodes that are included in the visibility list of the file. 

Users can restrict the visibility of their posts by encrypting them with connection keys. These posts require a decryption key be transferred between accounts when they become connections. Elevation to friend status transfers another key used to decrypt friend restricted data, and companion status transfers another decryption key. Supernodes manage requests for encrypted files, only sending files to accounts that are included in the visibility list of the post. Files are broken up into several pieces, requiring a complete set to access the entire file. These pieces are separated over multiple Supernodes, preventing any one Supernode from being able to send the file to accounts that are not included on the visibility list, or from censoring particular files, or from being able to delete files without a valid deletion transaction from its uploader. 

Access to Supernode computational resources is allocated by the value of stake on the WeYouMe blockchain. MePower each offers 1 unit of allocation of Network bandwidth, memory, and storage. MeCoin can also be converted into BAND, MEMORY, and STORAGE. Each of these resource allocation assets grants the holder a larger share in accessing a portion of WeYouMe’s resources. To be utilized, they are vested into an allocation address. When the storage, memory, or bandwidth is deallocated, the assets are returned. Each asset offers a share in the network’s resources equal to 10 units of MePower, but does not provide network voting power or vesting interest. 

Promoted posts on WeYouMe are served and selected by Supernodes, acting as decentralized advertising servers. Depending on the user that is logged into the interface, and which part of WeYouMe they are using, different promoted posts are selected for display by WeYouMe interfaces. Promoted posts that are relevant to the user, based on public profile information are selected for display using off-chain algorithms that are up to Supernode operators to determine. Supernodes are paid a share of the MeCoin used to promote a post, based on how many views and votes the post receives. Supernodes compete to offer the best advertising delivery at the best price per targeted action. Interface operators choose which Supernodes they want to serve promoted posts, to maximize the amount of total promoted post expenditure, as they earn a share in the value paid for post promotion for all the accounts that they register.


## 5.4.	MeCoin Reward pools:

1,000,000,000 MEC is issued by the blockchain per year.

### Content Reward Pool:

All posts are paid a reward distribution according to the votes and views that they accumulate over 30 days. Voting power scales with each account’s WYM, MePower, and MeBond balance. Payout scales with stake and time weighted votes and views to the power of 1.5. The content reward formula values are witness parameters that can be altered. 75% of content rewards are liquid, and 25% are vested into MePower. Content contributors are effectively paid 25% of the income of the WeYouMe network. 

Voting bots are a major concern that have reduced the quality of content on other blockchain social media platforms. WeYouMe mitigates this issue by reducing the effective vote value when repeatedly made to the same author. Votes repeatedly made to the same author’s posts decay in voting power by 20% per vote within the previous 7 days. This acts as an incentive to upvote the posts of different authors to earn a higher amount of rewards from curation. It also makes voting bots less effective when used on multiple posts in a short time period. The content reward distribution is also non-linear, ensuring that votes cannot be bought at a single face value. 

### WYM Reward Pool:

WYM holders are able to earn valuable rewards for their stake in the network. To earn this reward distribution, they need to make a minimum contribution to the network on a consistent basis. All holders of a minimum balance of WYM are able to claim a MeCoin reward, paid each week. This distributes 20% of total MeCoin issuance to the holders of the WYM cryptoequity. WYM takes 4 weeks to charge up to full power, and is always fully liquid to be traded and transacted. Once per week, All held WYM powers up by 25%. This conveys 25% of the standard voting power and reward share when held. Each week, this increases by 25% to the maximum after 4 weeks. 

WeYouMe stakeholders that satisfy these conditions receive an allocation of MeCoin proportional to their WYM balance: 

- 	Holds a balance of at least 1 WYM.

- 	Voted for at least 10 members of the Witness, Developer, Advocate and Marketing reward pools.

- 	Claimed at least 1 activity reward in the preceding 30 days. 

Highly Active Stakeholders are able to earn a greater share of the WYM Reward Pool. An account’s proportional reward share is doubled if it satisfies at least half of the following bonus requirements:

- 	Holds a balance of at least 10 WYM.

- 	Voted for at least 50 members of the Witness, Developer, Advocate and Marketing pools.

- 	Has claimed at least 15 Activity rewards in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has a WeYouMe Marketplace trading volume of at least 1 WYM in value in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has purchased or sold at least 0.1 WYM in value of premium content in the preceding 30 days. 

- 	Has a WeYouMe decentralized exchange trading volume of at least 1 WYM in value in the preceding 30 days. 

- 	Claimed more than 10 MEC in content rewards in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has referred at least one new WeYouMe account that has claimed an activity reward in the preceding 30 days. 

- 	Created a board, event, or group with at least 10 posts in the top 50th percentile of content reward value in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has mined or witnessed at least one block in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has received a distribution from a WeYouMe officer reward pool in the preceding 30 days.

- 	Has created an asset that has been traded by at least 20 accounts, and has at least 1 WYM in volume in the preceding 30 days.

### MePower Reward Pool:

All holders of MePower, and MeBonds receive interest in MePower from the vesting MePower pool. MePower takes 4 weeks to divest back into MeCoin in 4 equal weekly payments, and MeBonds cannot be powered down while they are vested. Both cannot be transferred to other accounts, or used for transactions. MeBonds receive a greater return on investment and voting power, equivalent to an increase of 50% per year that they are vested for. The total vesting reward pool is divided proportionately between MePower and MeBond holders. 

### Supernode Reward Pool:

Accounts can become Supernodes by completing the following requirements:

- 	Downloading an WYM node software client.

- 	Running the node actively in Supernode mode, with a full copy of the blockchain, and propagating transactions. 

- 	Holding an account balance of at least 100 MePower, and 1 WYM.

- 	Providing at least 10 GB of encrypted storage space to the network.

- 	Providing at least 1GB of RAM for memory allocation and processing to the network.

- 	Maintaining an average bandwidth (data uploaded plus downloaded from nodes) of at least 1 MBits/sec.

Supernodes must remain in the Supernode pool for 24 continuous hours and not fail a validity test to enter the Supernode Reward pool. Supernode rewards are distributed based on signed view transactions from account holders, and on anonymous view transactions created by groups of Supernodes and witnesses. The size of each file is multiplied by the amount of views it receives from accounts that nominated the node as a distributor. Reward allocations are increased by holding a higher amount of WYM and MePower on the Supernode. Supernodes that hold a balance of at least 10 WYM and 1,000 MePower receive a doubled proportional share of the Supernode reward pool. 

Supernodes are incentivized to host files that are in demand, and are likely to earn a high amount of stake weighted views. Supernodes are also incentivized to host files that are hosted by few other Supernodes, as they will be more likely to serve a higher amount of file views if there are less other Supernodes also hosting the same file. 

### Witness Reward Pool:

Accounts can become witnesses by completing the following requirements:

- 	Downloading a consensus supported WeYouMe node software client.

- 	Running the node actively in Witness mode, with a full blockchain, and propagating transactions. 

- 	When the witness is chosen, up to once every round, the witness produces a block containing the latest transactions of the network. 

- 	Witnesses are chosen in a random order each round, which is determined from the hash of previous mining blocks.

- 	Producing a continuous and regularly updated feed of witness parameters.

- 	Witnesses should have optimal uptime, and should not miss blocks.

- 	Witnesses are allocated the voting power of any accounts that support them and do not vote in network elections.

- 	Witnesses should always vote in every network election.

- 	Witnesses must vote to approve at least 1 Governance account for Consensus Moderation.

Network elections determine the issuance of MeCredit against network revenue, and the election of the WeYouMe executive board. For this reason, all witnesses should ensure that they always vote in every WeYouMe network election to best exercise the voting power of their supporters, and earn a split in the network election reward.
Mining Reward:

Accounts can become miners by completing the following requirements:

- 	Downloading a consensus supported WeYouMe node software client.

- 	Running the node actively, with a full blockchain to propagate transactions. 

- 	Running the node software in mining mode, causing the node to begin producing proof of work transactions.

- 	The miner joins the mining queue by publishing a valid proof of work. transaction, with a difficulty that scales with the amount of work done in the prior 7 days by the network.

- 	When a miner is selected, they produce a block and earn the mining reward as newly minted MeCoin in the miner’s account.

### Activity Reward Pool:

All accounts that are active earn a share in the activity reward pool. To claim this daily reward, accounts need to complete the following:

- 	Hold a balance of at least 1 WYM.

- 	Vote for at least 10 Witnesses.

- 	View at least one post.

- 	Vote on at least one post.

- 	Make at least one qualifying post or qualifying comment. 

Qualifying posts and comments must be in the top 50th percentile of votes and views by stake. Accounts additionally need to complete a small proof of work transaction in the background to prevent abuse of the activity reward. This would take around 60 seconds on an average computer. 

The pool is distributed proportionally to active accounts each day. WeYouMe accounts that hold a minimum balance of at least 10 WYM earn a doubled relative amount of activity rewards. Members and verified profile accounts gain bonuses to their activity reward pool allocation. This reward pool distributes value to all the network’s active users, and incentivizes daily activity. All tasks are simple and ubiquitous, such that a normal user would complete them inadvertently. Applications are able to automatically publish a transaction to claim the reward when the user is eligible each day

### Development Reward Pool:

Developers should produce new features, and fix bugs for WeYouMe and www.weyoume.io, or produce new applications that run on the WeYouMe network blockchain. They should complete code testing, and ensure that it complies with a high assurance security specification. They should construct and publish proofs that the WeYouMe codebase is secure. They should use a model of continuous deployment and aim for a monthly user experience update cycle. They should plan specifications for WeYouMe hard fork upgrades on a 6-monthly update cycle. The best developers are voted highly by the community, and receive ongoing rewards for their efforts, and funds to support their projects. 

Members are voted to positions in the Development pool, according to the development work done, as seen by the community. The top 50 members of the pool receive an equal split of 75% of the reward pool, and are the elected Development officers. These development officers are provided full administrative access to the WeYouMe code repository. All other accounts in the development pool earn a proportional share of the remaining 25% of the reward pool, according to their voting support. The split percentage between officers and the remaining members is an adjustable witness parameter. 

### Marketing Reward Pool:

Marketers should produce graphical assets, videos, or music to attract new users, investors, and content creators. They should actively engage with the community to help new users familiarize themselves with the website, and produce rich media for promotion in external communities. They should actively promote WeYouMe in other communities and act as ambassadors to promote new memberships. The best marketers are voted highly by the community, and receive ongoing rewards for their efforts, and funds to support their projects.

Members are voted to positions in the Marketing pool, according to the marketing work done, as seen by the community. The top 50 members of the pool receive an equal split of 75% of the reward pool, and are the elected Marketing officers. These marketing officers are tasked with managing the WeYouMe Social media channels on other platforms. All other accounts in the marketing pool earn a proportional share of the remaining 25% of the reward pool, according to their voting support. The split percentage between officers and the remaining members is an adjustable witness parameter.

### Advocacy Reward Pool:

Advocates should engage with the wider community, companies, and the branches of governments to obtain favorable legal recognition and favorable regulatory conditions for the WeYouMe network. They should work to promote and positively influence public discourse on cryptocurrencies, Blockchain networks, and Decentralized Applications. They should represent WeYouMe in discourse with other cryptocurrency businesses, and establish positive relationships with other members of the cryptosphere. They should promote the adoption of WeYouMe network cryptocurrencies with wallet providers, and exchanges. 

Advocates should work with entrepreneurs to promote WeYouMe based businesses to new customers and clients, publicize WeYouMe business use cases, and help to protect WeYouMe sponsored businesses from liabilities in legal proceedings where possible and warranted. Advocates should additionally interact with regulatory agencies to promote positive legislation that assists the cryptocurrency community. They should publicly speak in favour of these emerging technologies, and should establish WeYouMe as a pioneer of the cryptocurrency communities’ public image. Advocates should be individuals of high public standing, public profile, and of good character. They should ideally have backgrounds in public office, legal firms, political action organizations, or research organizations. 

Members are voted to positions in the Advocacy pool, according to the advocacy work done, as seen by the community. The top 50 members of the pool receive an equal split of 75% of the reward pool, and are the elected Advocacy officers. These advocacy officers are tasked with administrative access over any formal lines of communication with business partners, WeYouMe businesses, and government agencies. All other accounts in the marketing pool earn a proportional share of the remaining 25% of the reward pool, according to their voting support. The split percentage between officers and the remaining members is an adjustable witness parameter.

### Community Enterprise Fund:

The community Enterprise fund is the main income stream of the “community” account. The Community account is used to finance WeYouMe projects and businesses through funding, equity, credit, or competition proposals. Any WeYouMe account can create a proposal, which refers to a post. When a proposal is supported by 51% of the Witness, Mining, Developer, Marketing and Advocacy Officers, it is activated.  

Funding Proposals: Used for objective oriented task funding. The post should describe the project or business that is to be undertaken for the betterment of the network, and include at least 2 objective milestones. For each milestone that is completed, the funding proposal requests the payment scheduled for that objective. Each milestone releases funding when 51% of the Network officers approve. When the final milestone is completed, the proposal is closed. 

Equity or Credit proposals: Used to fund WeYouMe consortium business accounts by purchasing a cryptoequity or cryptocredit asset. The post should pitch the business model to be used, how it will benefit WeYouMe network users, and how it will earn a profit for cryptoequity and cryptocredit holders. If the proposal is approved, the asset is purchased from the decentralized exchange at the specified price. If the business underperforms, the Network officers can vote to liquidate the cryptoequity at any time afterwards by selling it on the decentralized exchange. 

Competition proposal: Used to reward the winning accounts of a competition. The post should specify the details of the competition, how long it is to run for, the completion date, and how the winners will be chosen. When the competition is over, the creator specifies the winning accounts, and the network officers confirm the integrity of the competition, and the accuracy of the winning selection according to the rules. When 51% of the network officers concur, the competition funds are paid to the winning accounts.

### All Reward Pools:

All votes for members of the Witness, Development, Marketing, and Advocate pools expire after 12 months. This ensures that consistent visible efforts are rewarded by receiving votes from the community regularly, while inactive pool members’ votes expire over time. Accounts can give new users links that create an account that votes for their own account in the officer reward pools. This vote will scale over time with the accumulated voting power of the users that they introduce to WeYouMe, rewarding officers that assist their referred users to positively contribute to the network and gain voting power. Witnesses, Developers, Marketers, and Advocates that do not hold a minimum balance of at least 1000 MEP, and 10 WYM have their vote support divided by 10, placing a soft requirement to hold this minimum balance, or they will be easily outvoted. The top 25 officers from the Witness, Development, Marketing, and Advocacy pool cannot vote for each other. Overall, the total supply of MeCoin is increased by approximately 2,739,700 units per day, by the creation of 33.333 units per block. The supply of MeCoin contracts whenever it is burned by the WeYouMe revenue distribution model.

## 5.5.	Network revenue distribution:

WeYouMe blockchain functions that consume MeCoin fees are used to generate revenue for the network. WeYouMe’s revenue distribution mechanisms deliver value to the holders and earners of MeCoin, and WYM. Revenues are earned from several sources, and are divided between network contributors and burning MeCoin:

- 	Account memberships: Paid monthly using membership asset market by burning proceeds of selling membership assets, revenue is shared with WeYouMe premium partners and the selling interface.
 
- 	Promoted Posts: Boosts the visibility of a post by displaying it in interfaces in-line with content posts. Revenue is shared with Supernodes, and participating interfaces. 

- 	Premium content purchases: 2% fee charged from sales of premium content, revenue is shared with Supernodes and the selling interface. 

- 	Subscription purchases: 2% fee charged on monthly subscription payments to access subscription content from creator’s access tiers. Revenue is shared with Supernodes and the selling interface. 

- 	Marketplace escrowed purchases: 2% fee charged from value of marketplace transactions, revenue is shared with mediators and participating interfaces. 

- 	DEX taker orders: 0.1%, maker orders have no fee. Revenue is shared with the trading interface. 

- 	DEX taker lending orders: 10% of interest, maker orders have no fees. Revenue is shared with the trading interface.

Revenue earned in MeCoin is used to buy the following set of assets under certain conditions:

- 	Priority 1: If the average trading value of MeUSD is below $1.00 USD, buy and settle MeUSD, and burn the MeCoin obtained.

- 	Priority 2: If the average trading value of MeCredit is below $1.00 USD, buy and burn MeCredit.

- 	Priority 3: Standard Operating Order – Burn received MeCoin to the “null” address on the WeYouMe blockchain, rendering it permanently inaccessible and removed from the supply.

## 5.6.	Referral System:

WeYouMe accounts list a set of addresses when they are created that offer an ongoing return to the accounts that introduced them to the network. Each account has a referral link that references their account’s username, and assigns them as the referrer when a new user create an account using an interface. 

A share of each account’s network revenue is distributed to its registrar, referring, and governance accounts. 

- 	10% - Registrar Interface/Referring account: The registrar interface is the account that paid the registration fee for creating the account. The registrar earns 10% of the network revenue of each introduced account.  Optionally, a share in this reward can be offered to another listed account that provided the referral for the registration using a link. This share is half by default, but can be altered. A fixed amount of MeCoin can be paid directly to the new account, and to the referring account by the interface to incentivize account creation through referrals. This additional reward is applied at the interface’s discretion.
 
- 	10% - Governance Account: Up to 5 Governance addresses can be listed by each account to earn a share of the revenue generated. Governance addresses are tasked with applying content tags for filtering, curating network participants, and managing security features for profile accounts by having two factor authentication procedures for payments and sensitive transactions. The “weyoume” account is selected by default on www.weyoume.io and the mobile app, and can be changed at any time to reflect individual user choices about content filtering. 

## 5.7.	Network elections:

All WYM, MePower, and MeBond holders are able to vote in network elections. Voting power holders that do not vote have their voting power split equally between their selected witnesses, who vote as a proxy for their supporters. Binary network elections allow users to select to “Support” or “Oppose” the motion. In order to be successful, must have 51% of voting power in favour of the Support option. Binary elections are used to:

- 	Approve WeYouMe sponsored businesses

- 	Approve issuance of MeCredit

- 	Approve hard fork upgrades to the WeYouMe network protocol

Weighted transferable vote elections allow users to select multiple options, in ranked order. The winning option is chosen by a process whereby all voting power in support of each option as number 1 is first allocated. The option with the least voting support is eliminated, and the voting power that supported it is reassigned to its number 2 option. The option with the least support is eliminated, and voting power is redistributed until an option has at least 51% of support in favour of it. This option is selected as victorious. Weighted transferable elections are be used to:

- 	Elect executive board members

- 	Choose the prioritization order of the WeYouMe application roadmap

Administrators are able to choose the graphical appearance of the, and can decide the default sorting parameters that are applied to the board when viewed directly. Boards have a configuration file that contains the sorting settings, and a CSS file for web and mobile display. They can add cover images, and change most of the graphical layout of the board by selecting icons, and including posting rules to display to new submitters. 

When a new board is published, its creator becomes the founder of the board, and can invite others to become administrators and moderators. Administrators can change the settings of the board, such as what should be posted, the background, and the layout. Moderators are tasked with removing content that breaches their rules, and can move a post to the deleted section of their board, which is not visible from the main page of the board, but can still be accessed as normal if desired by users. 

Posts can also be moved to different boards if they do not belong in the board they were posted in. Posts cannot be permanently deleted from the network, as they are stored on the blockchain. This reduces the ability for moderators to conduct unwarranted censorship. Each subscriber can vote for up to 10 moderators that they support. Moderators are ranked according to time adjusted vote weight (voting weight multiplied by the number of years of subscription to the board) from the board’s subscribers, and have hierarchical authority over which posts are removed from the board, or permitted, and what the board’s settings and rules are. Moderator votes expire after 12 months and must be reapplied afterwards. 

### Types of Boards:

-	Open Board: All posts are visible publicly, any account can create posts and interact with content.

-	Public Board: All posts are visible publicly, but submissions can only be made by accepted members. Anyone can apply to join, and moderators can accept requests and create invitations.

-	Private Board: All posts are private, and can only be viewed by accepted members. Posts can only be made by members. Anyone can apply to join a private group, and find it in search results.

-	Exclusive Board: Members must be invited to join an exclusive group by an existing member, and approved by an administrator of the board. Board is not visible in search results, and all details are encrypted.

## 6.2.	Groups:

Groups are a variant of board, with additional options for managing content to be more focused on the individual members within the group. Boards are visually focused on the topic of discussion and on the content directly. Groups are visually focused on the people that are creating the content. Board are optimal for creating communities around a specific topic of discussion, whereas groups are optimal for enabling existing communities of people to communicate about a range of topics relevant to them.

### Group options:

-	Limit membership to specific types of accounts.
-	Limit post types to a specified selection.
-	Limit membership to subscribers of a governance account.
-	Limit membership to accounts above a specified reputation level. 
-	Limit membership to Holders of a specified asset balance value.
-	Charge a membership joining fee or a regular membership fee.

Groups can create membership assets, which are expended to pay for membership costs. Assets are sold by the group creator for any desired price on the DEX, and can be bought directly from the group page. This acts as a way to finance the group’s collaborative expenses. Group members are removed after a predetermined time has elapsed since their membership expired. Group membership lists can be easily used to populate event invitation lists, and can be used as a prerequisite to owning any specified cryptoasset.

## 6.3.	Events:

Events are a variation of groups, which record the invitations and event details on the blockchain. Open and Public events display all details publicly, and anyone can attend.  In Private and Exclusive events, details are encrypted unless the account has been invited and accepted as a member.

Users can create ticket assets for their public event, allowing any account with a ticket entry. Tickets are sold on the DEX, and can be purchased directly from the events page. Tickets can be easily tracked for ownership, and auctioned to high bidders if limited tickets are issued. Entry staff confirm the possession of a ticket by authenticating the user’s account on phone contact, instead of having to use a physical ticket, or scan a code.

WeYouMe will display a list to event hosts containing all accounts that hold a unit of the cryptoticket, and requests a transfer, which the user approves for entry. This publishes a blockchain transaction whereby the ticket asset is expended on entry. The cryptoticket system prevents issues arising from lost, stolen, damaged and counterfeit physical tickets. They can be created for free, and are traded by users securely, with very low fees paid to the WeYouMe network when the user issued asset tickets are traded on the DEX. Private cryptotickets are restricted to the users that are invited to a private event.

## 6.4.	Featured page: 

High quality content posted by Mezzanine and Top Level members can be selected to be added to the featured page, which is the default front page of the www.weyoume.io website for logged out viewers. All posts made by these members within a 24-hour period are included in the featured calculation, which focuses on posts with a high amount of upvotes and views.

Every hour, the highest rated post by the featured ranking parameter is added to the top of the featured page. Posts leave the featured queue after 24 hours. The featured page retains a permanent link to all the past featured posts. The same account cannot be chosen to have a post added to the featured page twice in a row.

Every 24 hours, a board is chosen to be listed as the featured board. The featured board is calculated according to its New subscriber’s weighted vote power since last featured. The weighted vote power of each subscriber is added to a board’s feature value. When a board is featured, its feature value is reset to zero. As new subscribers join, the value increases. The highest value board by this metric each day is listed as featured. 

## 6.5.	Feeds:

Network feeds show selections of content from specific people or communities. Account feeds show all content from selected accounts sorted by the same formula set as Boards, with Quality (Default) as the default sorting option.

Feeds are the main way that users view private posts, that have visibility restricted to specified groups of people, such as connections or friends. Users can view posts from subscribed boards or followed accounts, sorted however they choose.

The user’s Home feed contains posts from all followed, connected, friend, and companion accounts, joined groups, invited events, and subscribed boards.

Ephemeral posts are also viewed in feeds and are shown as an album called a Daystream. Each user’s Daystream earns content rewards like a regular post which shows all temporary content uploaded by the user in the last day.

### Account feeds:

-	Home: The Home Feed combines all content from the user’s account feeds and is the default front page of logged in users.

-	Today: The users Today feed contains all the Daystream posts from their followed, connected, friend, and companion accounts.

-	Recommended: Shows posts that the Interface selects as recommended for the user, based on available public profile information.

-	Followed: Shows posts made by followed accounts.

-	Following: Shows posts made by accounts that follow you.

-	Connected: Shows posts made by connected accounts. 

-	Friends: Shows posts made by friend accounts.

-	Companions: Shows posts made by companion accounts.

-	Sphere: Shows public posts made by non-connected accounts that you have at least one mutual connection with.

-	Stakeholders: The most recent post from the accounts with the highest balance of WYM, in order.

-	WeYouMe Consortium: The most recent post from the highest market capitalization consortium businesses, in order.

## 6.6.	Discover:

The discover page shows recommended posts of relevant content that the user has not yet viewed. Additionally, on each page, the boards, tags, and author account from the content being viewed are used to find relevant posts to see next that are recently released, and highly voted. The recommended post display beside posts can be toggled off if desired. This delivers high quality relevant content to the user, and helps them to find new interesting posts, new boards, and tags. 

Users can access the recommended feed by clicking a link from each recommended post bar. This utilizes the user’s followed boards, liked posts, and followed accounts to generate recommendations of recent highly voted posts. 

## 6.7.	Wallet:

Users can access their balances of cryptoassets, and make payments using their WeYouMe wallet. Transaction history, MeCoin reward history, and membership assets can be inspected. Users can interact between their balances, settle MeUSD for MeCoin, vest MeCoin into MePower, divest MePower into MeCoin, vest MePower into MeBonds, or transfer any liquid balances to their respective savings accounts. 

Each WeYouMe account has a Hierarchically Deterministic wallet passphrase associated with it, giving every account a usable address and fully featured light wallet for many major cryptocurrencies. This passphrase can be used to restore the account. This interface enables transfers between the account’s wallet, and the DEX by purchasing gateway assets. These assets would be able to be redeemed by transferring to the user’s wallet, or an external withdrawal address at any time.

Savings accounts can be used for WeYouMe network currencies, by placing the funds into a separate balance that requires a 3-day time delay to withdraw funds. While funds are placed in savings accounts, the assets are automatically lent at interest to margin traders with market lending orders. This can be disabled upon user choice.

Third party developers would be free to produce code to incorporate their own cryptocurrencies into the WeYouMe wallet, and create and operate new gateway assets for use on the decentralized exchange, with no listing fees.

## 6.8.	Search:

Users can search the entire blockchain and public file database of the Supernode network for content with WeYouMe’s search feature. Sorted by relevance to the search terms, and weighted by upvotes, and views.

### Search types:

-	Post search: Searches for content in the public posts of the WeYouMe blockchain.

-	Image search: Searches for images on the Supernode network

-	Video Search: Searches for videos on the Supernode network

-	Audio Search: Searches for audio tracks on the Supernode network

-	Product Search: Searches for products for sale on the blockchain

-	File search: Searches for files that can be downloaded on the Supernode network.

-	Reverse image search: An image is searched for and matched against indexed content, returning similar images and their source posts.

-	Reverse audio search: An audio file is searched for and matched against indexed content, returning similar audio and their source posts.

-	Reverse video search: An video is searched for and matched against indexed content, returning similar videos and their source posts.

## 7.2.	WeYouMe Mobile Applications:

WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. will operate the flagship mobile application for a user-friendly mainstream facing social experience. The Mobile app will offer most of the functionality of the Web Application, with simplifications made to condense the Exchange, Marketplace, and Wallet. 

Advanced users, enterprise clients, and business operators will be able to access the WeYouMe Pro App, and access mobile streamlined tools from the Pro web application feature suite. 

## 7.3.	WeYouMe Desktop Full Node Application:

The Backbone of the WeYouMe Network will be the desktop Full Node Application. The WeYouMe Desktop Full Node will be available for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu users, and will synchronize and store the network blockchain, distribute and propagate blocks to connected nodes, and broadcast transactions to the network. It will operate a wenode daemon, and provide full access to the network’s transaction APIs. It will expose a port for interfacing with all other applications. 

Witnesses, Miners, and Supernodes Will operate a full node instance and are able to produce blocks, and manage their IPFS storage connection via the GUI. Advanced users will be able to directly view content from their locally synchronized copy of the blockchain and browse posts natively. All transaction types will be supported by the desktop node client, and will feature a command line transaction builder terminal. 

## 7.4.	WeYouMe FlashChain:

The WeYouMe FlashChain is a public blockchain that mimics the WeYouMe Public Blockchain Protocol, and offers application providers and users additional flexibility to manage and edit content post transactions, before they are broadcast onto the Main Blockchain. The FlashChain is a hybrid between a cloud caching database and a blockchain, wherein valid signed transactions may be written by any WeYouMe account holder, without immutability, and data is stored for a limited time.

Applications are able to utilize the WeYouMe FlashChain for the process of staging incoming user content post transactions for progressively increasing their immutability and managing content that is uploaded through their interface to meet their enterprise requirements.

- Proof of Authority block production: The blocks on the FlashChain are created and signed by the network’s application operating members, instead of elected witnesses. Any WeYouMe account that holds a top Level membership may create and sign blocks on the FlashChain. Block producers do not earn revenue for this procedure.

- Malleability: Transactions broadcast into the FlashChain may be pruned by the transaction’s originating account, or by a 51% majority of network authorities after they are broadcast. Any transaction may be deleted by a deletion transaction broadcast with either the original account signature, or by a majority consensus among block producers.

- 24 Hour Transaction Pruning: Transactions included and stored in the FlashChain are pruned after 24 hours, rendering them inaccessible after this time. The Block producers of the FlashChain rebroadcast transactions contained in each outgoing block into the main network after it has reached its 24 hour lifespan, after which time it becomes immutable. 

## 7.5.	FlashBase: 

WeYouMe FlashBase is an open source Middleware product for loading and storing the contents and transactions of the WeYouMe network into a database, to improve user facing read and write speed. 

FlashBase continuously synchronizes with the Application’s Local Database, the WeYouMe Blockchain and the WeYouMe FlashChain as the inputs, and provides an indexed document through which flexible database queries can be sent and resolved to return state information to be used in an application. 

This enables application developers a seamless experience when accessing Global Immutable state from the Blockchain, Global Mutable state from the FlashChain, and locally hosted public or private state from their own database.

FlashBase traverses the blockchain and loads content from the IPFS driven Supernode network for storage in the local server, to facilitate high throughput of media to the application user, without needing them to query IPFS at the time of the page loading.

Applications are able to immediately write to their local FlashBase data store, which then synchronizes with the WeYouMe FlashChain or Blockchain once every block by broadcasting stored transactions. This enables application state to be shared across users of the same application, before network consensus is achieved.

Applications utilizing the stack of FlashBase, FlashChain, The WeYouMe blockchain and a local database are able to offer users a characteristic 3 stage process of deploying a content post. 

1.	Flashed: A post is stored on the application’s local database and a hash of the content is uploaded into the FlashChain for synchronization with other Applications. The post is mutable and no permanent record of its existence is created. WeYouMe.io will utilize this stage for the first 24 hours of a post by default, after which it will be upstaged.

2.	Cashed: The post is stored on the application’s local database and a signed transaction containing the hash of the post content, and a link to it is broadcast to the Main Blockchain, where a record of it is distributed and made available to all nodes on the network. The user may still delete the underlying post from the local application’s database, and earn content rewards from the transaction containing the hash of the post. WeYouMe.io will utilize this stage for the next 7 days of a post by default, after which it will be upstaged.

3.	Hashed: The post transaction is edited to contain its full content data. Content is fully uploaded to the Network Blockchain, and continues earning content rewards. Files contained within are uploaded immutably for permanent storage in the WeYouMe Supernode network via IPFS, where it can be downloaded and served by all Supernodes, IPFS nodes, and Applications in perpetuity.

## 7.6.	Programmatic Accounts:

Programmatic accounts enable developers to upload self-executing code to the WeYouMe blockchain, by creating deterministic rules for how the account should respond to incoming transactions from users, and other programmatic accounts.

Programmatic accounts can be deployed onto the network to send and receive cryptocurrency or broadcast any kind of network transaction in response to an incoming transaction, or state function of the WeYouMe network. WeYouMe will utilize Web Assembly to enable the specification of programmatic account transaction execution rules. All transactions available on WeYouMe can be broadcast in response to incoming transactions to a programmatic account. 

Programmatic Accounts can be used to:

- 	Read public files in the Supernode network
- 	Create and upload new files to the Supernode Network
- 	Charge subscription fees from a user’s wallet
- 	Read public posts and execute transactions with them as parameters
- 	Create new public posts
- 	Vote for content posts
- 	Accept incoming assets and redirect them to any set of accounts based on any function of the input assets
- 	Execute Exchange trades

### 7.7.	Network Applications:

Users and developers create applications that are hosted on the WeYouMe Supernode network. Applications can access all public WeYouMe blockchain data through the use of programmatic accounts, and can decrypt private profile information with user permission and a connection transaction between the Application’s account, and the user’s for transferring the private decryption keys. They can natively transact blockchain assets, may be purchased as premium content, and can charge ongoing subscription fees to the user’s wallet balance using recurring payment transactions.

Decentralized Applications uploaded to WeYouMe Supernodes can be accessed using a web browser, a WeYouMe desktop client, from within the WeYouMe mobile application, or through any other application that has access to the Supernode network and Blockchain. Applications can be downloaded from the network through the application store on WeYouMe.io for multi-platform usage across all devices. When a user downloads a WeYouMe application on one device, it is automatically downloaded across all devices that the user signs into when they first log in. 

## 7.8.	Network Linking Protocol:

Specific usage of punctuation creates an automatic link via a regular expression to a particular page while using WeYouMe Applications, and should be supported across the third party application ecosystem:

- 	Posts and comments: Posts are linked to with >> before their post ID number. (>>7777777, >>1234567, >>1010101)

- 	Boards: Boards are linked to using the ~ character. (~All, ~General, ~Pictures)

- 	Tags: Tags use the # character to link to the search page for all posts using that tag, sorted by new. (#Hype, #WYM, #PicOfTheDay)
 
- 	Usernames: Account username links use the @ character (@haz, @alice, @weyoume)

- 	Cryptoassets: Asset exchange links use the $ character ($WYM.BTC, $MEC, $MeUSD)

# 8.	WeYouMe Accounts:

Accounts represent the users of the WeYouMe network, and are used to interact with the blockchain by signing transactions using the private keys of the account. Each account is fundamentally a set of public and private keypairs published to the blockchain. Accounts are used to make posts to the blockchain, hold cryptoassets, and interact with other user’s posts. 

### Signing Keys:

- 	Owner key: The most important key of an account, used to login to the account with full access, and change all other keys. The private owner key is derived from the account password and account name, and should never be shared.

- 	Wallet key: Used to sign all financial transactions of the account, exchange trades, asset settlements, and user issued asset creation. This can be shared to enable external transactions to be made from this account.

- 	Posting key: Used to sign all posts and comments made to the network, the creation of boards, and uploading of files to Supernodes. This can be shared to enable external posting from the account.

- 	Interaction key: Used to sign post voting, sharing, and viewing transactions. This can be shared to enable external voting from the account.

### Encryption Keys: 

The public key is used to encrypt data, and private keys are shared with other accounts upon connection for decryption of private content. Groups, and Events each have their own keypair for encryption of posts and metadata, and admission of new members:

- 	Connection key: Used to encrypt private posts and account metadata, that are visible to connections.

- 	Friend key: Used to encrypt private posts and account metadata elements that are visible to all friends.

- 	Companion key: Used to encrypt private posts and account metadata elements that are visible to all companions.

- 	Secure key: Used to encrypt private data that can only be decrypted and accessed by the account. Used to decrypt incoming private messages that have been encrypted with the public secure key. Public key is used to encrypt incoming secure data, such as connection keys. The secure private key is never shared. Other keys are distributed by publishing a transaction directed to the account, containing the desired private key, that is encrypted by the recipient public secure key.

### Account creation:

Accounts can be created on the blockchain by paying an MeCoin account creation fee, which is vested, and added to the MePower balance of the new account. The account creation fee is a witness parameter. The vesting value that is required for creating an account will be equal to $0.20 MeUSD in MeCoin. Account names cost a higher fee when they have shorter names. If an account has no numbers, full stops, or hyphens, the fee varies according to the length of the name.

AccountCreationFee(length)=0.2*2^( (16-length) )         MeUSD

50% of all issuances of content or activity rewards to newly created accounts will be repaid to the account registrar, up to a limit of 5 times the account creation fee paid. The account registrar and an optional nominated account referrer each earn a 5% share of all fees, post promotions, and memberships paid to the network by the account for the duration of its use. If there is no nominated referrer, the registrar receives both shares. This will incentivize users to refer new users to the platform to create WeYouMe accounts. It also makes it profitable for account registrars to create new accounts for users, by paying the registration fee and earning it back out of the account’s revenue.

The WeYouMe main account “weyoume” will pay the fee to register new accounts on www.weyoume.io and the WeYouMe mobile application out of its Application revenue, and if required, MeCredit issuance. Other applications are free to register new accounts, and may use their own antispam features at their discretion. Accounts can also be created by mining block rewards onto an account keypair set. Accounts hold decryption keys for content that is visible to them. They have many different key pairs that are used for different functions. 

Accounts can specify a set of recovery accounts, that are able to recover the account in the event that the account is hacked by changing the ownership key. Each account can list up to 3 other accounts that act as trustees to verify the identity of the account holder off-chain. The user broadcasts a transaction requesting that the ownership authority be changed to a new key. This transaction must be signed by a recently used owner authority. They then verify their request to their trustees through off-chain channels. When all the trustees confirm the owner authority transition, the owner authority is changed to the new authority.

Accounts can specify a set of inheritance accounts, that will receive a distribution of the assets held by that account if it becomes inactive in the event of the owner passing away. When the account has not broadcasted any transactions for 12 months, it becomes inactive. At this time, all nominated inheritance accounts can broadcast an inheritance claim transaction. When the nominated recovery accounts all confirm that the account owner has passed away and sign a confirmation transaction, the assets of the account are divided between nominated inheritance accounts according to the user’s predefined ratios in 50 weekly distributions of 2% of account assets. If the account makes any transactions during this time, the inheritance process ceases. This is structured as a pre-signed recurring payment transaction that is only valid when the account is inactive, and is co-signed by the inheritance accounts.  

### Private Messages:

Each account can send and receive private messages by sending message data packets to the Supernode network, that are encrypted with the secure public key of its intended recipients, and the private secure key of its sender. Each publicly specifies a set of at least 3 Supernodes to act as message servers.

Private message data is then sent to these three messaging Supernodes. When each user logs in, they request all messages sent to them, decrypt them with their private secure key, and then decrypt them again with the public secure key of its stated sender to verify its authenticity. When received, the user signs and publishes a view transaction referencing the encrypted private messaging data to award the Supernode network rewards for holding the data, and to signal a read receipt to its sender. 

## 8.1.	Persona Accounts:

Personas are the base layer account made to represent users or other entities. They are used for all network functions, such as posting and sending and receiving transactions. Persona accounts do not require an information link to the account owner. Personas can have followers, connections, friends, and companions. They can be used to post pseudonymously, to create a posting identity separate from your own for use on boards and groups or holding funds privately and sending private transactions. 

Persona accounts can alternatively be used to make pages for inanimate objects, and concepts and can be followed. Followed persona accounts from specific categories are listed on profile pages under their respective topic category. 

Posts are added to feeds with variable visibility. Visibility is controlled by encrypting content on the blockchain, accessed by decrypting with various keys, to control information visibility to specific intended recipients. Posts can be visible to specific sets of people, with increasing exclusivity. Accounts can link themselves into 4 levels of association. Posts that are made by more closely connected accounts are boosted by the connection factor parameter when sorting content. 

### Followers:

Profiles can be followed without permission and all Followers are visible to the account owner. Posts to boards, profiles, and pages are included in user’s feeds. Follower visibility is the default posting option. 

### Connections: 

Profiles can become Connections with a Connection request, which is confirmed by the receiving account owner. Accounts can have an unlimited amount of Connections. Connected accounts can send encrypted private messages, images, videos, audio recordings, live video chat or make voice calls, using a mutually agreed Supernode.

All private messaging content has an optional deletion after a specified time, or after being viewed. Accounts that send each other at least 1 message or image within each discrete 25-hour period have a day counter displayed that shows how long they have consecutively stayed in contact. At milestones of days, a new icon displays. These icons can be customized by users to any other emojis if they choose. 

### Friends: 

Profiles can become Friends after being Connections for 1 week. Posts made by friends generate a notification, and posts that are made by friends, or upvoted by friends using the shared voting power are ranked higher in the Home Feed using the connection weighting parameter.

### Companions:

Profiles can become companions after being Friends for 1 week. Companions can create joint wallets, which can spend cryptocurrencies with multisig permission functionality. Joint funds are sent back to their depositor if the accounts expire their Companionship. Posts made by or upvoted by companions using shared voting power always appear first in the Home feed.

## 8.2.	Profile Accounts:

Profile accounts are more secure versions of persona accounts, that offer fully featured and customizable representations of the identities of WeYouMe users. Users should make one profile account per person, and interfaces are advised to verify a user’s email address and phone number before the creation of a profile account.
Users of profile accounts provide their email address and phone number to their initial governance address when creating their account, to verify that they are genuine users, rate limit profile account creation, and maintain external communication with the user. Profile accounts include a salted hash of the email and phone number used to create the account to enable importing of contact lists by email and phone number. Private account information is encrypted with keys that are shared with connections.

### Security Features:

Profile Accounts have security features that can be activated. These depend on the user’s governance address having access to their email address and phone number.

Two-Factor authentication: The governance address is added as a signing authority to the account’s wallet authority, and must verify payments, withdrawals from savings balances, and exchange trades. The governance address is able to request a two-factor authentication code before signing these transactions to protect user funds from theft.

Password resetting: The user can publish a transaction requesting that the account authorities be updated to utilize a new password in the case that it is forgotten or hijacked. The user must confirm their identity using a series of recovery questions and confirming control of the email address and phone number used to create the account. The governance address is then able to confirm the transaction to update the account password.

## 8.3.	Verified Accounts:

Verified accounts are profile accounts that are accurate representations of a unique human person, that have profile information that is true, and have provided sufficient evidence of genuine personhood, and have sufficient activity and stake on WeYouMe. Individuals that wish to hold high positions of public influence should verify their accounts to prove their identity. This process is optional, and is not required for the fully featured use of profile accounts. 

Becoming Verified:

Each profile account needs to satisfy the minimum requirements to become verified (known as a “minimum qualifying account”):

- 	Account must be at least 3-months old.

- 	Account must have earned at least 10 MEP in author rewards.

- 	Account must have claimed at least 10 Activity rewards.

- 	Be connected to at least 10 accounts that satisfy the first three conditions.

Once an account has surpassed the minimum requirements, it can make a verification post on the blockchain. Verification posts must be posted to the verification board. This verification post should contain an image or video of the user holding a piece of paper with:

- 	The most recent block ID.

- 	Their profile account name and number.

- 	The current date and time.

- 	3 Pending Verification Applicants: The user implicitly approves these prior applications and refers to them in their verification transaction. 

- 	3 Existing Verified Accounts: The user nominates three existing verified users to validate their identity, and refers to them in their verification transaction. 

- 	3 Active Witnesses: The user nominates three witnesses to validate their identity, and refers to them in their verification transaction.

A user’s verification post can then be approved by other users. The community votes on whether the verification post provides:

“Sufficient evidence that this profile account represents a real unique human person, with public profile information that is accurate, that no other verified accounts exist in this person’s name, that this person is of good character, and that this person is in good standing within the community”. 

To be accepted, verification posts must:

- 	Be supported by a net voting power equal to a minimum of 10 average users.

- 	Have received supporting votes from at least 10 minimum qualifying accounts.

- 	Be confirmed by at least two of the three nominated witnesses.

- 	Be confirmed by at least two of the three nominated verified accounts.

- 	Have at least two new verification applicants refer to them as a pending verification nominee.

- 	Be confirmed by the account’s initial governance address with a two-factor authentication to the account’s specified email address and phone number.

Applications have 7 days to be accepted, before they are rejected. Accounts must wait at least 7 days before resubmitting another verification application. Verification posts pay out all author rewards earned to voters if successful, with curation time weighting towards early voters. 

If unsuccessful, the post declines all rewards, and pays out nothing. Minimum qualifying accounts can vote for up to 5 verification posts per day, which do not consume voting charges. It is therefore optimal for all users to vote for 5 of the most genuine undervalued verification posts per day, to receive the largest curation share. Network officers can vote for an unlimited amount of verification posts. 

Successfully verified accounts receive the following benefits:

- 	1 month of complimentary Mezzanine membership, activated instantly on the account. 

- 	The ability to become a mediator in the marketplace.

- 	The ability to apply for a WeYouMe Executive officer position.

- 	A permanent 50% increase to activity reward shares, which stacks additively with membership bonuses.

- 	A “Verified Profile Account” badge next to the account name throughout the network, which could act as a significant indicator of trust in the marketplace, boards, network officer voting, and executive elections.

- 	A permanent 10% boost to received voting power as a network officer. 

It is up to users to decide the extent of any additional trust to place in verified accounts, and how the highly the community values the distinction. This verification is publicly accessible and provable on the WeYouMe blockchain, and could be extended to third party applications. Profile verification is difficult and expensive to falsify, cannot be forged, cannot be physically lost or stolen, and does not require any interaction with a state entity to corroborate. 

The verification post is permanently and publicly accessible, and can be used to visually identity a person for proof of identity. This kind of identity verification could have value outside of the WeYouMe network, and creates a strong one-to-one relation between a physical person and a digitally secure account. 

## 8.4.	Business Accounts:

Entrepreneurs and business owners can create a business account to register their business on the WeYouMe blockchain. A business account is structured as multisignature account held by a group of founding accounts. Each business account issues a cryptoequity asset to its founding accounts to represent voting power and ownership.

Business cryptoequities are used to represent ownership of a WeYouMe business, and all accounts that own cryptoassets in a business can vote in all business elections, and automatically receive a proportion of the income earned by the issuing business account. Cryptoequities are traded on the DEX, and by default issue a distribution of 5% of all revenue earned by the account from product sales, network rewards, tips, premium content sales, and asset trading fees to holders every week. The distributions rate of 5% is variable, but 5% is considered standard. Business accounts can choose to disable automatic revenue or net profit distributions, and manually issue distributions. This allows owners to determine how much profit to distribute each week. Once the cryptoequity is created, the revenue distribution rate cannot be lowered.

Multiple cryptoequities can be created for each business account. Different classes of cryptoequity can have a voting power multiplier that can be used to offer more business account voting power and a revenue sharing multiplier to offer different streams of return.

Accounts that are elected to hold business leadership positions are able to access the business account and conduct executive functions. Cryptoequities are backed by the assets in the wallet accounts of their issuing businesses, which are publicly transparent. Additional assets owned by the business can be recorded on the blockchain, and all accounting records can be uploaded to the Supernode network, and secured on the blockchain. Cryptoequity holders in WeYouMe businesses receive quarterly reports on the accounting activities of their investments. Businesses can also source capital by borrowing money from investors using Cryptocredits, which are recorded on the blockchain as debts, and are paid back automatically from the business account’s wallet funds over time, and from sales. Companies that default can be placed into administration by the popular vote of their shareholders, and all the business assets are distributed to shareholders proportionally.

Business accounts are able to conduct all their transactions and accounting using the WeYouMe network. They are able to send invoices to customers by requesting payments, selling products and services on the marketplace using mediation, with the blockchain to act as an immutable receipt, paying employees with recurring transactions, and raising capital by selling their issued cryptoequity.

Businesses with existing equity structures can import their shares into WeYouMe by creating gateway assets for users to purchase shares, and redeem them from issuing equities exchanges. A business would limit their dependence on government based registry systems and established financial systems, and have a very low barrier to market entry. Business accounts receive integrated access to low cost data storage, a business accounting platform, integrated marketing tools to promote their posts and products, and a business account to streamline product purchasing and the coordination of customer service. Businesses can create constitutions, and publish them securely to the blockchain. 

## 8.5.	Account memberships:

Account Memberships subscriptions can be purchased from the network by buying membership denominating cryptoassets from the Decentralized Exchange. 

There are three levels of WeYouMe blockchain membership: 

- 	Top Level: Network Power users, Enterprise Users, Business owners, and Application developers and operators.

- 	Mezzanine: Active content creators and premium content viewers.

- 	Standard: Entry level premium account.

A smart contract issues a membership asset to accounts in exchange for incoming MeCoin, with prices denominated in MeUSD. The price of memberships are an adjustable witness parameter.

The assets can then be activated on an account, denominating membership for that account. The membership asset balances of all member accounts decrease by 1 per month by automatically burning 1 unit to a network address to reactivate recurring membership. If 10 membership assets are bought and activated at once, an account is allocated 12 months of membership at a discounted annual rate. MEC received from the sale of membership assets is used to buy and burn assets from the DEX, using the revenue distribution model. 

Incoming Membership revenue is distributed to network contributors:

50%: Network Revenue.
25%: Premium content partners, according to value spent by members.
25%: Application Interface that sells the membership asset.

This distribution provides an income stream and an incentive to WeYouMe application developers to sign up new users, promote the purchase of a membership in the interface, and retain membership subscribers.

All membership benefits are inherited to higher membership levels. Percentage bonuses do not stack with higher membership levels. The registrar and referrer of each account earns a share in the membership revenue of all the accounts that they introduce to WeYouMe for the lifetime of the account. 

### Top Level Membership:

Price: $250.00 per month.

- 	Governance account, and Interface account revenue activation.

- 	Access to WeYouMe Pro Suite for enterprise.

- 	$750.00 per month of Premium Partners Content Credit.

- 	WYM Stakeholder Dividend boosted by 10%.

- 	Access to the WeYouMe FlashChain for interface management.

- 	30% Voting power boost.

- 	Activity pool reward share boosted by 100%.

- 	20% Content reward boost.

### Mezzanine Membership:

Price: $25.00 per month. 

- 	Posts eligible for WeYouMe Featured page.

- 	Activity pool reward share boosted by 50%.

## 8.6.	Anonymous Users:

Posts can be made to WeYouMe anonymously, without any connection to an identity, or account. Posts that are made anonymously must include a proof of work proportional to their data size to be included in a block, to rate-limit them. 

Anonymous posts are made using a ring signature and a stealth address system, so that the address used to make and sign the post can also be used to edit or delete it, when signed. The stealth address is used to make the post is mixed in a ring signature with other stealth addresses from previous anonymous posts, so the author of each post cannot be determined. 

This address earns MeCoin in content rewards, using a stealth transaction. The proof of work requirement to make anonymous posts increases exponentially with the amount of anonymous posts in the last hour, causing any anonymous network spam posts to become computationally expensive. Anonymous posting routs connections through TOR.

Users that have the Safe or Family content management setting selected will not see posts made by anonymous users, to prevent expose to potentially undesired content types. 

# 9.	Posts:

Posts are the main units of content on WeYouMe. Posts to the WeYouMe blockchain can link to files stored on the IPFS data storage of the network Supernodes. Posts can be made public, where their contents are not encrypted, and can be read by all. Public posts can be listed in a board, and use an unlimited number of tags. Public posts include the ~All board by default, but this can be removed. They are also listed on the user’s profile, and in feeds that include the post creator.

Posts contain content data fields:

- Title: The name of the post that can be searched for and displayed for discovery.

- Post Type: The type of post being displayed, image, article, text. Used for formatting the content in interfaces.

- Body: The main plaintext section of content within the post that is displayed when opened.

- IPFS: An array of IPFS file links that are preloaded for display as the leading image thumbnail by applications, and within the body.

- Magnet: An Array of BitTorrent Magnet links to file sharing swarms for peer to peer download.

- URL: A URL HTTPS link for the post to direct to.

- JSON: A string of a JSON object, containing expandable interface specific information about the post.

Posts can be made by users privately. These private posts have limited visibility, are made to user’s profile pages or private groups or events. Private posts contain links to encrypted IPFS files, and cannot be viewed by users that do not have the decryption key passed in the connection process. Private posts encrypt the on-chain reference to the files, so that the title and comments can only be read by users with the decryption key. Private posts are typically viewed in feeds by accounts that are connected to the posting account. 

Ephemeral posts can be made that store encrypted private content files on a specified small set of Supernodes, which is automatically deleted after 24 hours. These files are not accessible without two decryption keys. One key is held by the intended audience via connection transactions, and the other is requested for each file from the uploader’s nominated Supernodes, which distribute the decryption key for a limited time before deleting it.

Content can be uploaded for a 24-hour time period in each account’s Daystream post, which earns content rewards in the same way as regular posts. Daystream posts use the same post object, which is edited to include newly added content. Deleted previous content is removed from the post. Daystream posts earn content rewards permanently, and accumulate votes and views over the lifetime of the account.

## 9.1.	Comments:

All posts can be commented on with any other type of post, and are voted on exactly like posts themselves. Each post can contain an unlimited amount of comments, with any comment depth. Each comment pays out 20% of its content rewards back to the post or comment on it was made on.

All posts and comments can optionally set a price in MeUSD that must be paid to comment on them, which is paid to its author. Boards can also set a posting price, which is paid to the moderation team according to voting support. This can act as a spam filter, and reduce the amount of low quality comments that are made to a post, if desired. If the author selects, the comment price can be directed to several alternative options:

- Refunded after 24 hours, when voting power is net positive.

- Donated to a nominated charity address.

- Burned as network revenue.

- Added to curation rewards paid to upvoting users.

Users are able to overpay the comment price to create a comment bid. 
Comments with the highest bids are shown first in the comment sorting on threads by default. When the Author replies to the comment, they receive the total amount of the comment bid.

## 9.2.	Post Types:

There are many different types of posts for all content that is stored on using IPFS on the WeYouMe Supernode network. On www.weyoume.io they are all displayed by default, however boards and third-party applications can customize which posts types to display.

- Article post: Contains a full page of markdown enabled text content, with embedded images, videos, audio, and downloadable files. Article posts can be opened as a large window over the board, or in a new tab as a full scrolling window with comments, and recommended posts alongside it.

- Link post: Contains a link to a webpage, and a description of up to 1000 characters. Link is opened in a new tab. Can be double clicked to open the link post in a new tab to view the description, comments, and recommended posts.

- Text post: Contains up to 300 characters of text. All text is displayed in line with board posts as a text bubble. Any images, videos, audio files that are linked are previewed below them. Can be opened in a new tab to view comments, and recommended posts.

- Image post: Contains a single inline image and a description of up to 1000 characters. Can be opened in a new tab as a large image with the description, comments, and recommended posts.

- Video post: Contains a single inline video and a description of up to 1000 characters. They are opened in a new tab as a large video player with the description, comments, and recommended posts.

- Audio post: Contains an audio file, displayed as a waveform, and a description of up to 1000 characters. Can be opened in a new tab as a large audio file player with the description, comments, and recommended posts, or opened in a music bar and added to the current playlist.

- Playlist post: Contains a group of audio files, and a description of up to 1000 characters. They are opened in a new tab as an audio player with the description, comments, recommended posts, and a list containing all audio files in order. Can be shuffled, played in order, or added to the current playlist in the music bar.

- Gallery post: Contains a group of images or videos, and a description of up to 1000 characters. Gallery posts can be opened in line with board posts by expanding them with a button, and navigating between the images and videos with arrow buttons. Can be opened in a new tab as a list of all images and videos in order, with the description, comments, and recommended posts.

- File post: Contains a file, or group of files and a description of up to 1000 characters. Download posts are opened and downloaded from peers. Can be opened in a new tab to view description, comments, and recommended posts. Files can include music, movies, games, applications, or documents. Download posts count stake weighted downloads instead of views.

- Vote post: Contains at least 2 voting options, and a description of up to 1000 characters. Vote posts can be voted for in line with board posts. They can be opened in a new tab to view description, comments, and recommended posts. 

- Livestream post: Contains a currently active livestream of video or audio, and a description of up to 1000 words. Livestream posts can be opened in line with board posts and viewed as a normal video or audio post. 

## 9.3.	Collaborative Content:

Creators can collaborate on content, by suggesting an edit or modification to the text of a post or article. This process can be used to manage publicly curated content, such as encyclopedic articles, or improve writing structure, correct mistakes, and add relevant information. The author is able to choose which additions and deletions they merge in with their post. By default, authors distribute 20% of their content rewards between editing users to incentivize contributions from the community. 

- PostChain: Collaborative timeline of consecutive posts. A PostChain is a consecutive series of linked posts that is updated each day with the highest voted reply to the previous day’s post. The WeYouMe network will have a canonical PostChain starting in the genesis block called “The WorldLine” which will contain image posts, and be featured prominently in applications for global interaction. Users that are featured in the WorldLine will have their accounts added to the default follow list of new accounts on WeYouMe.io and the mobile app. Each WorldLine image should be relevant to an important international event or phenomena. Users vote each day for the best image, and it is added to the WorldLine at the end of a countdown timer. Each WorldLine post earns its own content rewards, and returns 20% to the post before it, as it is a comment. By default, the WorldLine is viewed in full screen in reverse order, going back to the beginning, one image at a time, and grows longer with each day. New users can easily find the WorldLine and view it from start to finish to get up to speed on the culture of the network, and see each day in its history. 

- MixPost: Community edited content: Image, Video, and Audio edits can be facilitated by uploading the raw content as a file in a MixPost. Users can then download the files and create their own high quality composition from them, such as editing videos together, editing images to correct them or add text, or mixing music from sample tracks. The comment with the highest voted media output from the raw image or video files is displayed in place of the original post, and its creator earns 50% of the content rewards for the post at the end of each day. This allows for a continually evolving piece of collaborative content that can mutate and improve according to voting power shifts between comments. Each successive interpretation of the original files can be used to generate ideas for the next commenters iteration. Media from contributors can be updated to continually improve quality to compete against rival commenters.

Collaborative content can be facilitated by unique group post types. 4 Pieces of content in comments are combined together according to voting power of the community. Each comment uses a number tag #1, #2, #3 or #4 to determine it’s position. On each of these post types, the uploader has veto power over all pieces added into the main post, and can remove commented parts, which revert to the next highest ranked piece of the same number. The commenters of the 4 highest ranked selected pieces earns 20% of the content reward at the end of each day.

- GridPic: Collaborative image post. Consists of 4 square images arranged in a grid. The uploader chooses 4 initial square images, and the community can upload comments with square images that substitute in for one of the squares by using a number tag. After 6 hours, the highest voted image for each number is shown in one of the squares. 

- GroupVid: Collaborative video post. Uploader selects an audio backing track of up to 60 seconds, and 4 initial videos with the raw files for editing. The community can then upload new or edited videos in comments which build on the backing track, and are shown in a position chosen by their number tag. After 6 hours, the highest voted video for each number is shown in one of the segments. 

- MixTape: Collaborative audio post. Uploader selects 4 initial audio tracks of exactly 60 seconds each, and uploads the raw files for editing. Commenters can then add new audio tracks of the same length with edits and changes, along with a number tag. After 6 hours, the highest voted audio track for each number is substituted in during that duration. 

## 9.4.	Content rewards:

All posts are eligible to receive a distribution from the content reward pool. 25% of all MeCoin created is awarded to content creators and the accounts that interact with content to provide information to the blockchain. By default, 75% of the payout is earned by the author over 30 days, with the remaining 25% being split between curators, viewers, view referrers, and Supernode hosts. The amount of MeCoin that is received as content rewards by posts is added to each account’s “Lifetime content rewards” value. Profiles display the lifetime content rewards that the account has earned, as a measure of overall contribution and reputation. 

Voting power is added to each post by upvoting it with a user determined weight. The user’s voting power is divided into 1000 charges, which are applied to upvotes to weight them. The default charge weight is 10, the maximum is 100, and the minimum is 1. Charges are replenished at a rate of 1 per 1.44 minutes, fully recharging over 24 hours. Accounts cannot upvote when they have no charges left, and cannot use more than 20% of remaining charges on one upvote.
Accounts that create posts receive rewards from the content reward pool, according to the amount of voting power that has upvoted their post, and the amount of voting power of the users that have viewed the post. 

VotePower=WYM*WYMPrice+MEP+VestYears*MEB Balance

An account’s voting power is determined as the balance of WYM, weighted over 4 weeks as voting power increases, plus the price ratio adjusted balance of MePower, plus the vesting time weighted balance of MeBonds. The WYMPrice is the feed price of 1 WYM in MeCoin.

WeightedVotePower (WVP)=VotePower*NumberOfAccounts/TotalVotingPower

Each account’s voting power is divided by the average voting power of all accounts to find the weighted vote power, a multiple of the account’s voting power relative to the average of all accounts. 

VoteRewardShares (VRS)=Max(0,∑(WVP_Up*Charge/10)-∑(WVP_Down*Charge/10))^1.5

All Posts have a current value of vote reward shares as the magnitude of their total Weighted vote power, raised to the power of 1.5. This is floored at 0 to resolve the case of negative net voting power.

ViewRewardShares(ViewRS)= 
((1/TotalViews)*(∑Upvotes*charge/10-∑Downvotes*charge/10)*(∑(WVP_viewer ) ))^1.5

All Posts have a current value of view reward shares, determined by each viewers voting power, raised to the power of 1.5. This is multiplied by the ratio of votes to views, to relativize the values of views and votes.

TimeWeightedRewardShares (TWRS)=
(VRS+ViewRS)*Max(0,(1-DaysSincePosted/30))

All posts have a current value of time weighted reward shares, which adds the value of voting reward shares with the value of view reward shares. This is multiplied by a linearly decreasing factor over 30 days, from 1, to 0. 

ContentReward (CR)=TWRS/TotalTWRS*ContentRewardPool

Every day, a post’s time weighted reward shares value is recalculated, divided by the total number of time weighted reward shares for all outstanding posts, and multiplied by the amount of MeCoin that is inside the content reward pool.

The content rewards are paid out every 24 hours, after which the time weighting value, Days Since Posted, increments up by a day. 

This formula suite has the overall effect of combining relativized values of votes and views to determine post payouts, and decreases the payout share of a post over time. Posts receive daily rewards over 30 days, and older content earns less relative to newer content. Post payouts scale non-linearly with the amount of votes and views that they get, making artificial voter collusion difficult, and organic large scale voter consensus valuable. 

The amount of views is included in author reward valuation to promote genuine user engagement and votes, instead of encouraging automatic voting without viewing the content. Like voting, views are also weighted by stake weight, preventing Sybil attackers from spam viewing posts. Each account can only contribute 1 view per post per day to stake weighted views.

In addition to receiving content rewards from the blockchain reward pool, content creators can also receive optional tips from viewers. Common tip denominations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 MeUSD) can be sent directly to the creator’s account by sliding a tip button. Viewers that tip the post creators are featured below the post, in order of the amount donated. 

Curators are rewarded for voting on posts by receiving a curation reward payout according to the amount of voting power they have contributed to the post, and how early they voted for the post. 
In order to incentivize users to actively vote for high quality content and rank it for other to see, curators are rewarded with a percentage of the content rewards of each post.

CurationRewardShares (CVS)=0.5^((PriorUpvotes/100))*WeightedVotePower*Charge/10

Curation vote shares are calculated when upvotes are added, by multiplying the weighted vote power added by a factor that decays by 5% for each subsequent upvoter. 

CurationReward (CR)=CRS/TotalCVS*PostCurationReward

Viewers are rewarded for publishing view transactions that include their voting power for stake weighted view calculations. View transaction include a list of Supernodes that contributed data for loading the content files of the post, Supernodes are rewarded for providing the resources to store and serve the post file content via a peer to peer transfer. 

ViewRewardShares (VRS)=0.95^log_10⁡(PriorViews) *WeightedVotePower

View reward shares are calculated by finding the Weighted vote power of each viewer at multiplying by a factor that decreases by 10% for every magnitude of 10 increase in viewer numbers. 

ViewReward(VR)=VRS/TotalVRS*PostViewReward

Moderators are rewarded for their effort in removing posts that violate the board’s rules, and for building a high quality community. This also ensures that moderators are compensated for their time and effort, that there is competition between moderators to earn the support of their communities, and that there is demand to replace moderators that act against their community’s interests, or overzealously censor posts. Posts that are removed from a board do not pay out rewards to the moderators.

ModerationReward(MR)=ModVotes/TotalModVotes*ModReward

Each post’s split for moderation rewards are divided between the elected moderators on the board it is posted to, according to the voting power received, relative to all the moderators. 

The reward payouts from the WeYouMe blockchain for content rewards are split between the following divisions:

- Author rewards: (60%) Paid to the author of the post.

- Curation rewards: (25%) Paid to the curators of a post, according to their stake weight and the amount of voting charges used.

- Hosting rewards: (5%) Paid to the Supernode file hosts according to the recorded account holding viewer data nominations.

- Viewer rewards: (5%) Paid to declared account holding viewers according to their stake weight.

- Moderator Rewards: (5%) Paid to the moderators of the board(s) that the post was listed in, according to each moderator’s voting support from the board subscribers.

Content creators can choose to receive their author rewards in the following proportions, in which the liquid EziraCoin is automatically used to purchase other assets directly at market price:

- Default: (75% MeCoin, 25% MePower) MeCoin is received as normal.

- Vested: (100% EziraPower) MeCoin is immediately powered up into MePower when received.

- Stable: (75% MeUSD, 25% MePower) MeCoin is immediately used to purchase MeUSD with a market order.

- Equity: (75% WYM, 25% MePower) MeCoin is immediately used to purchase WYM cryptoequity with a market order. 

- Split: (25% MeUSD, 25% MeCoin, 25% WYM, 25% MePower) MeCoin is immediately used to purchase a third of its value in WYM, and a third of its value in MeUSD.

- Declined: No payout is made for the post, leaving its potential author rewards in the content reward pool for other posts to earn. This option should be used for all official communications by WeYouMe Executive officers and executive board members. This option may also be used to make clear that the post is not intended for monetary reward, which may indicate credibility and sincerity to readers. 

## 9.5.	Post Sorting:

Posts are sorted by a parameterized formula, that allows users to combine and customize many different metrics. Content sorting uses 10 parameters, each set to an integer value between 0 and 100:

- Latency Factor (LF): Varies the weighting of post age against post scoring from all sources.

- Equalization Factor (EF): Varies the distribution of Weighted vote power to be equal, or stake based.

- Reputation Factor (REPF): Determines the relative weight of posts made by users with higher reputations, measured by lifetime content rewards earned.

- Activity Factor (AF): Varies the time used for latency between the post time, and the time of last comment. 

- Vote Rank (VR): Varies the weight of post score by voting score.

- View Rank (VIR): Varies the weight of the post score by the amount of weighted views.

- Share Rank (SR): Varies the post score by the amount of weighted shares.

- Comment Rank (CR): Varies the post score by a combination of commenting metrics (number, length, unique commenters)

Once the values of the sorting parameter have been determined by the user, the posts are sorted by the following formulas:

AccountVotingPower(ACVP)=WYM*WYMPrice+MEP

An account’s voting power is determined by its balance of WYM, adjusted for balance time over 4 weeks and MEC price, plus MePower vesting balance. The MeCoin Price is equal to the witness feed settlement price of 1 WYM in MEC.

VotePower (VP)=∑(charge*ACVP_Up)-∑(charge*ACVP_Down)

ViewPower (VIP)=∑[log_2⁡(SecondsViewed/60+1)*ACVP_viewer   ] 

SharePower (SP)=∑[log_2⁡((Followers_share)/100+1)*ACVP_sharer  ] 

CommentPower (CP)=∑[log_2⁡(TotalCharacters/100+1)*ACVP_commentor  ] 

A post’s net vote power takes the sum of all curators upvoting vote power subtracts the sum of the Downvoting vote power. A post’s Viewing Power determines the time and vote weighted viewing score. The share Power determines the follower and vote weighted share score of the post. The comment power determines the character weighted and voting power weighted comment score of the post. 

AverageVotePower(AVP)=TotalVotingPower/NetworkTotalVotes

AverageViewPower(AVIP)=TotalViewPower/NetworkTotalViews

AverageSharePower(ASP)=TotalSharePower/NetworkTotalShares

AverageCommentPower(ACP)=TotalCommentPower/NetworkTotalComments

The average voting power, viewing power, share power, and comment power values track the average amount of voting power directed to posts through interactivity in the last 30 days, by taking the sum of all power values applied, and dividing them by the total number of each type of transaction over a 30 day rolling average.

ViewVoteRatio(VVR)=TotalVotingPower/TotalViewingPower

ShareVoteRatio(SVR)=TotalVotingPower/TotalSharePower

CommentVoteRatio(CVR)=TotalVotingPower/TotalSharePower

The Power ratio values track the relative values between voting power, and viewing power, sharing power, and comment power, by converting them to effective units of voting power for use to normalize the sorting algorithm to weight each equally relative to other posts on the network.

WeightedVotingPower (WVP)=VP*(1-EF/100)+PostVotes*AVP*(EF/100)

WeightedViewPower (WVIP)=VIP*(1-EF/100)+PostViews*AVIP*(EF/100)

WeightedSharePower (WSP)=SP*(1-EF/100)+PostShares*ASP*(EF/100)

WeightedCommentPower (WCP)=CP*(1-EF/100)+PostComments*ACP*(EF/100)

The weighted voting power of a post applies the equalization factor to the Net Voting power of a post, by adding a linearly increasing value of voting power equal to the number of votes, multiplied by the average voting power, and subtracting an equivalent fraction of the Net Voting Power of the post. Posts with higher amount of votes from less funded accounts rank higher with a higher equalization factor. This applies a gradient between democracy and meritocracy on all posts.

VoteScore (VS)= Log_2 (|WVP|+1)*Sign(WVP)

ViewScore (VIS)= Log_2 (WVIP*VVR+1)

ShareScore (SS)= Log_2 (WSP*SVR+1)

CommentScore (CS)= Log_2 (WCP*CVR+1)

A The Vote, View, Share and Comment Score of a post takes the respective weighted power value of each interaction type, and determines its logarithm to a base of 2, with 1 added to the magnitude to resolve the Log(0) case. VoteScore additionally determines the correct sign of the voting power in the case of net negative voting score after equalization. Other values are normalized relative to voting power by their respective ratios.

AuthorReputation(AR)= Log_2 (LTRewards+1)*Log_2 (LTRewards_followers+1)

ReputationScore (RS)=Percentile(AR_user )/100*10

Reputation score determines the multiplier for the content posts of accounts based on the product of total lifetime reward earnings, and that of the accounts that follow them, both to a logarithm of base 2. The percentile of Author Reputation values that the user lies within when ranked against all network accounts is then multiplied by 10 as a percentage. This results in the highest reputation account having a multiplier factor of 10.

PostScore (BPS)=(VR/100*VS+VIR/100*VIS+SR/100*SS+CR/100*CS)*(1+REPF/100*RS)

Postscore calculates the total of all the post element scores, each multiplied by the user determined Ranking factors for votes, views, shares, comments, and adds a random number, Rand, multiplied by the post’s random factor for use in shuffling posts on each reload, while maintaining a bias to sort higher ranked posts above others. Then it multiplies this score for each post by the user’s decided factors for boosting accounts that have a higher reputation, and that they are connected to.

ActivityWeightedTime (AWT)  = PostTime*(1-AF/100)+LastCommentTime*(AF/100)

Activity weighted time determines the number of seconds since the genesis block that the post was created, weighted against the number of seconds since the genesis block when the last comment on a post was made. This increases the rating of a post by bumping it each time a comment is made for greater values of Activity Factor.

TotalPostScore(TPS)= PS*(LF/100)+(AWT/3600)*(1-LF/100)

The Total post score is determined by the combined metrics of the post’s quality, PostScore, weighted against the newness of the post. Newer posts will have higher value of time added to them, which is normalized to 1 hour per 1 unit of post score. A higher latency parameter will result in older, higher quality posts being rated above newer posts, while a lower latency will rank newer posts above older posts with a higher post score. A lower latency will make the ranking of the posts on a page change more rapidly as newer posts are made. A higher latency will cause post rankings to remain more constant, and require larger amounts of votes and other metrics to rank highly. Posts on all boards are sorted from highest to lowest values for this final formula, which incorporates all user weighting parameters, and times.

## 9.6.	Sorting parameter presets:

User Interface applications enable the user to adjust the parameters using a sliding scale. They may also select and provide preset configurations to guide mainstream users:

Connections: Liked, viewed, commented, shared, tipped

Author Account Type: verified accounts, profile accounts, persona accounts, member accounts, officer accounts

Connection degree: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th

## 9.7.	Recommendation sorting:

Posts on the WeYouMe network may be displayed based on recommendations for each specific account. Recommendations are aimed to help users discover new accounts to follow, that they do not already follow. Recommendation sorting is determined by the user’s interactivity history with other posts, and by the degree of connectivity between each account, based on the common followers, connections and followed boards of those users.

Each post has a minimum threshold to be recommended of at least 20 votes, 100 views, 5 shares, and 10 comments.

The Adjacency factor between two accounts is the sum of all followed and connected accounts, boards, and tags that the accounts both share.

AdjacencyFactor(AF)=Followers_common+Following_common+Mutual_common+Connections_common+Friends_common+Companions_common+Boards_common+Tags_common

The Vote Preference Factor of an account for a post is the sum of all positive, minus negative, votes for posts with the same author, tags, and board. Votes in the last 30 days are boosted by a factor of 5.

VotePreferenceFactor(VPF)=(PriorVotes_author+PriorVotes_board+PriorVotes_tag)+5*(RecentVotes_author+RecentVotes_board+RecentVotes_tag)

The View Preference Factor of an account for a post is the sum of all views for posts with the same author, tags, and board. Views in the last 30 days are boosted by a factor of 5.

ViewPreferenceFactor(VIPF)=(PriorViews_author+PriorViews_board+PriorViews_tag)+5*(RecentViews_author+RecentViews_board+RecentViews_tag)

The Share Preference Factor of an account for a post is the sum of all shares for posts with the same author, tags, and board. Shares in the last 30 days are boosted by a factor of 5.

SharePreferenceFactor(SPF)=(PriorShares_author+PriorShares_board+PriorShares_tag)+5*(RecentShares_author+RecentShares_board+RecentShares_tag)

## 9.8.	Premium content:

Posts on the WeYouMe blockchain can be monetized by being uploaded as premium content. These posts require the viewer to purchase them, using MeUSD or MeCoin before being able to decrypt and view them. Users can easily purchase content with only 2 clicks, creating a frictionless way to monetize high production value media. Premium content sales can be used for large production teams to earn revenue for music, movies, TV shows, games, software, or any other digital media. After it is bought by the viewer, it is decrypted and viewable to their account. The content is hosted in the Supernode network, and can be viewed, or downloaded as desired.

Fiat currencies can be used to purchase MeUSD, which are then relayed to the content producer at point of sale using payment gateways. Premium content is sorted using the same formulas as board posts, but would replace stake weighted views with net purchase revenue. Premium content can be voted on for author rewards just the same as free content, so premium authors will need to balance the price of their content to ensure that a large enough segment of users are able to afford to purchase it, and vote on it. Initial parts of the content can be released publicly, so that there is a leading element to describe and give a sample to prospective purchasers.

The WeYouMe network includes a 2% fee on revenue from purchasing premium content. The premium content fee is divided to network contributors:

- 50%: Network revenue.
- 25%: Supernodes that distribute the file content, and decryption keys.
- 25%: Interface that sells the premium content.

Premium content creators can optionally choose to make their account into a WeYouMe Premium Partner by enabling all WeYouMe blockchain members to access their premium and subscription content for free up to a certain limit depending on membership level. 

Premium partners receive a share in the revenue earned from WeYouMe membership sales. The amount they receive is weighted according to the total free content allocation spent to access their posts. This revenue split percentage is a witness parameter, and starts at 25%.

## 9.9.	Subscription Content:

Content producers can earn revenue from ongoing monthly account subscription payments. Viewers chose their amount to pay each month, and have access to content equal to or below that subscription tier. Subscription payments are set to repeat automatically every month until deactivated. Different tiers of membership fee contribution can be offered with arbitrary levels of access to exclusive content, and rewards. 

The WeYouMe network includes a 2% fee on subscription payments each month paid to access subscription content. This fee is distributed to network contributors:

- 50%: Network revenue. 
- 25%: Supernodes that distribute the file content, and decryption keys.
- 25%: Interface that sells the subscription payment.

Accounts can create and offer their own membership assets, which can be bought to grant free access to all levels of premium and subscription content released in the past, and for the next year. These assets are burned to null to activate membership. Premium creators can offer store discounts to their account membership holders. 

Accounts can link their premium content, subscription, and membership revenue to any cryptoasset, and have a percentage of their revenue earned used to issue distributions to their User Issued Asset. This can be used to finance high production value content, and reward their supporters. User issued asset distributions are paid weekly by default.

# 10.	Advertising:

WeYouMe enables all users to promote their posts to increase the reach of their content, products and communities. By paying in MeCoin, a user or business can add their content to the promotion queue for selection by Supernodes for hosting, and interfaces for display to their visitors. 

## 10.1.	Network Advertising:

The WeYouMe Advertising system will be deployed in a three stage process, moving from selecting display creative from third party advertising servers using open source software, towards on-protocol advertising according to demand and traffic outcomes.

### Stage 1: Minimum viable delivery

Deployment of Revive Ad Server on weyoume.io (Free, open source), to enable server side ad loading, and injection of creative into feeds as native ads. Self-serve platform for business accounts to upload creative and manage campaigns. Weyoume.io connects to third party ad networks for initial advertising before significant internal self-serve ad buys are present. 

Key formats:
In Feed web native display: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio
In feed mobile native display: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio

### Stage 2: Self-Service platform

Deployment of Self-Serve platform for the WeYouMe protocol’s decentralized ad exchange, enabling real time bidding for display inventory across all protocol interfaces. Weyoume.io displays both on-protocol advertising, and off-protocol advertising from campaigns and from third party ad servers according to bid conditions.

Key formats:
In Feed web native display: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio
In feed mobile native display: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio

WeYouMe decentralizes its advertising model by using on-chain transactions to measure campaign performance, and distributes funds to advertising participants. A portion of funds paid for advertising are paid to the network revenue distribution mechanism.

A portion of ad spend is distributed to network contributors that are responsible for displaying and selling advertising. This aligns network incentives, and ensures that interface developers are rewarded when they display network advertising inventory.

### Advertising revenue distribution:

- 50%: Interface application that displayed the ad.
- 25%: WeYouMe Network Revenue.
- 7.5%: Demand Side Application that created the campaign.
- 7.5%: Audience accounts that view the ad.
- 5%: Demand Side Application that created the bid.
- 5%: Supply Side Application delivered the inventory.

This distributes a share of the value derived from advertising to the network participants that hold and earn MeCoin, such as content creators. Interfaces have the freedom to determine which advertising they choose to display, and how to implement the visual appearance of the creative. They are all incentivized to drive a positive result for the advertiser. 

Each campaign specifies the duration of time to be displayed, expenditure rate, and metric for cost allocation:

-	Cost per Impression
-	Cost per Click
-	Cost per Action

### Stage 3: Protocol-Server Hybrid Solution

Deployment of Adzerk hosted Ad server for WeYouMe.io, with connections to third party ad servers. Native in-feed video and display ads are served via Adzerk API, once a threshold of site traffic is reached to cover Adzerk hosting expenses. Integration with internal protocol self-serve platform for business accounts. Ideal end state of Integration with Teads for video creative demand sourcing from premium advertisers.  

Key formats:

In Feed web native display and outstream video: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio
In Feed mobile native display and outstream video: 1:1 ratio, 4:3 ratio
Vertical native full screen outstream video: 9:16 ratio
Vertical native cinemograph outstream display: 9:16 ratio
Vertical native parallax scroller outstream display: 9:16 ratio

### Viewability:

WeYouMe.io will measure advertising impressions after they have been viewed for at least 2 seconds for display, and at least 3 seconds for video, and separately measure completed views after 15 seconds for video. 
Video ads will only load when at least 50% of pixels are in view of the user. 
At launch, weyoume.io interface will display one advertising item per 10 items on the page, and incrementally increase to one advertising item per 6 items at a rate of one per year. 

### Brand Safety:

WeYouMe will ensure brand safety for advertisers by only showing third party ads to users that are browsing using a whitelisted WeYouMe governance address, on a display mode that only displays posts that have been rated Family Friendly, or General Audience.

WeYouMe on-protocol advertisers will be able to specify the advertising conditions that they want to abide by, defaulting to only displaying to users with a whitelisted governance address set, and display settings of their choosing.

WeYouMe will work with the board moderators of global communities to rapidly respond to content that is not suitable for advertisers, by appending a moderation tag to posts, causing them to be filtered from the user experience on our flagship web applications and mobile applications. Board moderators will receive rewards for helping to quickly identify and classify content that is not within the guidelines of their board, and outside of community expectations for creators.

### Transparency: 

WeYouMe will be the first decentralized social media protocol to support an integrated peer to peer direct advertising exchange system for inventory Publishers and Advertisers. This protocol will enable for fully audible display advertising bidding and trading, with a portion of advertising spend being transmitted directly to the user.

We do not expect that this system will gain immediate traction, but will provide powerful tools for advertisers to individually shift from other demand side platforms to hosting their content on the WeYouMe protocol, and enjoy fully transparent ad delivery transactions as proof of delivery, and fully granular audience segmentation by on-protocol username.

Until Such a time as the protocol integrated advertising system becomes economically viable, and is validated by market demand, Weyoume.io will utilize third party display and video advertising, and will follow independent auditing procedures to ensure that ad products are meeting the highest standards of delivery and value for advertisers.

## 10.2.	Network Real Time Bidding:

Advertisers are able to use Real Time Bidding to purchase display inventory from WeYouMe Applications. Each application connects to the peer to peer WeYouMe Ad exchange to receive signed bid transactions for each page display. This process allows for immediate payment from advertiser to inventory supplier, by processing through the exchange.

1.	The application sends a transaction requesting bids for display for a specified user to their nominated ad serving Supernode. 
2.	The Ad serving Supernode of the supplier broadcasts the signed request for bids transaction to the network.
3.	The Ad serving Supernode of advertisers respond with their real time bids for inventory purchase. 
4.	The best offer is selected and returned to the supply side application for display by their ad serving Supernode.
5.	The value paid for the display inventory is equal to the price of the second highest bidder, paid by the highest bidder to incentivize the buyers to bid their true value.
6.	The final transaction for payment is validated for fee distribution, and user revenue distribution by witnesses and miners, and is broadcast to the blockchain.

Interfaces have an incentive to sell advertising to their demand side channels, and to show creative that has the highest bid available. When creative is viewed by the user, their application can sign a view transaction containing the hash of the creative content data to certify that the inventory has been delivered. The ad serving interface may then distribute a portion of their supply side revenue to the user after signing the view transaction.

Advertisers may specify a whitelist of governance addresses and interface addresses that their content will be displayed with, to protect their brand image, and prevent delivery of branded creative alongside undesired classes of content. Whitelisted Applications will only display creative to users that have currently accepted the filtering policies of one of the nominated governance addresses in the bid.

## 10.3.	Creative Formats:

Advertisers can purchase campaign creatives with the following default network formats, and can implement their own with an emergent liquid market:

-	Standard post: Shows a post in its native format, with a promoted label. Shows in all other sections regularly as a normal post, according to rating, and earns content rewards. (Cost per Action: Vote, share, comment, follow)

-	Premium post: Shows a premium post in its native format, with a promoted label and a purchase button. Shows in all other sections regularly according to rating, and earns content rewards. (Cost per Actions: Purchase, vote, share, comment, follow)

-	Product: Shows a featured image, gallery or video, a slide to purchase button, a banner link to view the product, and an add to wishlist button. (Cost per Action: Purchase, wishlist, vote, share, comment)

-	Link: Shows a featured image, gallery, or video with a banner link to a desired external webpage or application. (Cost per Action: Click through)

-	Board: Shows a featured image for the board, with its name, and a subscribe button in a banner link. (Cost per Action: Subscription, board post, board vote, board share, board comment)

-	Public Group: Shows a featured image for the group with its name, and a join button in a banner link. (Cost per Action: Subscription, group post, group view, group vote, group share, group comment)

-	Account: Shows the account profile image, with its name and a follow button in a banner link. (Cost per Action: Follow, account post view, account post vote, account post share, account post comment)

-	Store: Shows a featured image, gallery, or video and a shop button in a banner link. (Cost per Action: Store purchase volume, store follow, store post view, store post vote, store post share, store post comment)

-	Cryptoasset: Shows the asset name, 30-day price history graph, icon, volume, 24-hour price change, and an DEX trade button in a banner link. (Cost per Action: Volume traded, asset view, asset vote, asset share, asset comment)

## 10.4.	Advertising Optimization:

Inventory bidding can be targeted and optimized by any Demand side Application according to WeYouMe blockchain public transaction, and account data. Each user's private account data is encrypted in their account metadata attributes, and cannot be accessed for advertising targeting purposes without the direct permission of the user.

Users may connect with their desired interfaces to enable the decryption of private account data, for an ongoing fee from the advertising revenue generated from display inventory sales. Each interface is able to determine their distribution, and compete with other interfaces for user data by paying higher fee rates. The WeYouMe.io and WeYouMe mobile applications will lead the ecosystem with an advertising revenue share rate of 25% to all users. The network will specify a global minimum revenue sharing value determined by network witnesses, starting at 5%. 

Public targeting specifications can be used to direct inventory bidding towards users that have:

-	Followed or connected to a specified account.

-	Subscribed to a specified board.

-	Joined a specified public group.

-	Attended or followed a specified public event.

-	Upvoted, viewed, shared, or commented on posts from a specified account within a time range.

-	Posted to a specified board or public group.

-	A specified balance of a specified public cryptoasset.

-	A specified WeYouMe membership level or higher.

-	Earned a specified amount of lifetime content rewards.

-	Purchased products from a specified public store.

-	A specified product on their public wishlist.

-	A specified amount of exchange trading volume in the prior 30 days.

-	Used a specified WeYouMe application interface within a time range.

-	A verified profile account, or are verified by a specified account.

-	A specified number of followers or connections.

-	Have received a specified number or value of content upvotes, views, shares or comments in a time period.

-	Purchased a specified volume of premium content from a specified account.

-	A specified percentage of followers or connections in common with a specified account.

-	Created a public post that used a specified tag, or contained a specified set of keywords in the title or body within a time period.

-	Received a specified number of activity rewards within a time period.

-	Have purchased a specified value from WeYouMe stores in a specified time period.

-	Are subscribed to a specified governance address.

Any formulaic combination of these metrics and targeting criteria can be combined logically to create a custom audience for real time bidding selection by Ad serving Supernodes. 

www.weyoume.io, the WeYouMe Desktop client, and the WeYouMe Mobile app will display relevant promoted posts within the application to users that do not have a WeYouMe membership. One in every 10 posts displayed in boards, groups, feeds, tags, and search results pages will be selected by an Ad Serving Supernode according to bid value.

Engaging, popular, and entertaining creative items have the ability to earn content rewards to offset or even exceed their display ad spend. This ensures that advertisers aim to deliver high quality, genuinely valuable creative, and a positive advertising experience. Conversely, downvoting a post will cause that promoted post to not be shown to that user again, lower its content rewards, and hide the post. A new promoted post will be selected on the next page refresh.

## 10.5.	Broadcast Advertising:

Users and businesses that wish to gain a large rapid exposure are able to issue a broadcast post by paying MeCoin directly to users, based on each user’s broadcast price. Broadcast post creators must nominate a broadcast rate to be paid per user, and pay twice this amount to the network, up to a specified maximum number of claiming users.

Each user sets their own desired broadcast price, which is the minimum required to receive a broadcast. Broadcast posts trigger a notification, and carry a message to all users that have set their broadcast price to below the advertiser’s selected broadcast rate.

The network will broadcast the post with the highest broadcast budget  once per 24 hours, to limit the frequency of broadcasts to a reasonable rate. Broadcast budget is determined by the greatest price per user, multiplied by the maximum number of claiming users. Broadcast posts may contain up to 300 characters, and are formatted as a text post.

Users redeem their broadcast reward by signing a view transaction on the post before all the broadcast budget allocation is claimed. This allows the broadcaster to validate the volume of exposure they have generated on-chain, and only pay for received rapid user engagement. The proceeds of broadcast post payments are divided as follows:

- 50%: Selected number of first responding users.
- 5%: Supernodes serving the broadcast post file data from the queue.
- 10%: Application Interfaces that the broadcast post was displayed on.
- 10%: Application Interface that the broadcast post was sold on.
- 25%: WeYouMe Network revenue.

By default, users have an initial broadcast price of $1.00 MeUSD, and can raise this to any desired number or lower it to change the frequency of broadcast post acceptance. They can additionally be completely disabled to never receive broadcast posts.

# 11.	Content Management:

WeYouMe empowers the global community to play an active role in the management of content on the network. By combining blockchain storage and the distributed memory, or Mempool of the network’s nodes, a hybrid posting system is able to offer users selective immutability. 

Each post transaction offers users the choice of posting ephemerally, or permanently, and includes a Broadcast Finality Time before it is included in the blockchain by Witnesses and Miners. After being broadcast by the user, the transaction is distributed across the network to all consensus nodes and stored in the mempool. By default, this time is 24 hours in the future on all WeYouMe interfaces. After the delay has elapsed, the post transaction becomes valid and can be included in the blockchain by block producers.

If it is a permanent post, it is then included in a block by a witness or miner. After being included in a block, posts cannot be removed from the blockchain and are thermodynamically secured by POW with each confirmation. Content files are then encrypted, split up, and held on the Supernode network, offering high availability and are content addressed, facilitating immutability.
Content should not be uploaded to WeYouMe permanently if the user does not want it to remain publicly, and immutably accessible for all time, even long after they are dead. 

If the post is an ephemeral post, it is deleted from the mempool of all nodes upon its expiry, rendering its content irretrievable from the network.

Before the post has been finalized, the content uploader can issue a signed deletion transaction, which directs Witnesses, Miners, and SuperNodes to delete the post transaction, and all its encrypted file pieces. This allows users to undo an accidentally made post, or post that is regrettable after reconsideration. If Supernodes are found to provide a file that has a deletion order from its uploader, they are dropped by other SuperNodes and are removed from the Supernode reward pool, causing them to lose Supernode rewards for a minimum of 24 hours. Posts can be updated by users by rebroadcasting a transaction that changes the post using the same permlink. 

To customize their viewing experience, users can use settings to control the content language that they see. All posts to WeYouMe must include a two letter ISO 639-1 language tag, such as #en, #zh, #hi, #ar, #ko, #es, #ru, #de, or #fr. Users can switch to display posts from a chosen language, or multiple languages. 

## 11.1.	Content Filtering:

To limit the proliferation of certain types of content that pose concerns to the community, users can add reporting tags to posts that they believe fit into certain categories.

Posts tagged with these categories can then be tagged by the governance address, which will cause them to be filtered by their subscribing users, and by the board moderators, who can apply tags to posts in their administrated boards. 

On WeYouMe.io and all WeYouMe applications, users can choose to apply filtering conditions to posts. Users can filter, hide the thumbnail, or grey out posts that: 

-	List any specified tags
-	Are posted to muted boards
-	Are posted by a certain muted user
-	Have a title containing specified keywords

Or are made by accounts based on:

-	MePower balance
-	Account age
-	Total connection weight
-	Number of followers
-	Anonymous posts
-	Persona account posts
-	Non-verified profile account posts

User have the ability to decide what they do and don’t want to see. Most default filtering can be deactivated, or changed to different display options. 
Default network tag settings are applied to all WeYouMe boards and feeds. They can be disabled if the user opts out. It is up to the community to decide which other tags they create and enforce by applying them to content. Posts with a net negative voting score are greyed out by default. 

## 11.2.	Board Moderation:

Moderators have sole discretion in the matter of which posts are and are not allowed on their boards, and decide on its rules. To enforce board rules, Moderators can delist a post from a board when two moderators concur that a post should be delisted for violating the board’s rules, and either placed in the deleted section of the board, or moved to a different board. Two higher ranked moderators are required in order to restore the post from the deleted section. Additionally, Users can be temporarily delisted from a board for up to 1 year with the approval of at least 2 moderators. If the members of a board do not agree with the actions of specific moderators, they are able to vote for different moderators to have a greater rank and advocate for change in the board’s post acceptance and delisting policies.

##  11.3.	Governance Accounts:

Users are able to specify a Governance Account to act as a provider of moderation and administration services. These features are used at the interface level, and can be toggled by users. For their services, they earn a share in 10% of each subscribing user’s network revenue. They are incentivized to offer services to users and block producers to gain subscribers to their governance account, to promote network growth and increase user retention.

-	Content filtering: Whenever a governance account votes to apply a tag to a post, all the users of that governance account follow their tag conditions. This allows users to choose which content guidelines to enact on their interface. Governance accounts are notified when one of their subscribers attaches a tag to a post or comment so that they can review it and match the tag if in concurrence. 

-	Profile Account management: Governance accounts are able to generate profile accounts. They are required to securely store the profile account’s email address and phone number for identity verification in the case of a lost password and for two-factor authentication of transactions. They are able to offer KYC / AML / CTF verification for users, and securely store this information off-chain for use across the network on the user’s behalf. 

-	Mediator curation: Marketplace mediators can be selected to be added to the governance accounts list of “Trusted mediators”. Fraudulent mediators can be added to a list of “Untrusted Mediators”. By default, the marketplace interface will show the trusted mediators list of the governance account first, and will denote untrusted mediators with an “Untrusted” tag. 

-	Recommended votes: When users create a WeYouMe account, they are shown a template guide for which Witnesses, developers, advocates and marketers to vote for, as “Recommended votes”, which can be adopted with a single click.

-	Asset and business ratings: Governance accounts are able to post a rating out of 10 on each asset traded on the decentralized exchange, and each business account on the marketplace for how strongly trusted the asset or business is. 

In addition to these network services, governance accounts also have the freedom to provide off-chain services and benefits to their members to encourage subscriptions. The governance account structure can be utilized to finance public service projects, content production, and targeted rewards to network contributors. 

The WeYouMe executive team will operate a governance account with the weyoume main account, that will be subscribed to by default for users on WeYouMe.io and the WeYouMe mobile application.

## 11.4.	Hardline Network Tags:

The WeYouMe protocol utilizes a set of hardline tags that are used for content that is considered to be illegal in most jurisdictions. Such content violates the Non-Aggression Principle of WeYouMe, and these filters will not be able to be disabled on WeYouMe.io or the Mobile Application. Hardline content tags from the user’s governance accounts cause automatic post filtering. When users apply these tags to a post, they notify their account’s and their interface’s governance accounts.

-	#underage: Explicit content that violates international age of consent laws.

-	#nonconsent: Explicit content featuring participants that have not consented to the media being publicly posted.

-	#casualty: Content that depicts violent death, homicide, or suicide.

-	#terrorism: Content that promotes or features acts of violence by militant organizations or individuals.

-	#doxxing: Content containing the non-consensual release of private personal information or any account private keys in plaintext.

-	#incitement: Content that makes direct and actionable threats of violence, death or encourages suicide against a person or group. Posts that offer services pertaining to acts of violence or homicide.

## 11.5.	Interface Content Preferences:

Users are able to set their interfaces to four preset modes to offer a different variety of experiences. The Standard setting is applied by default, and other selections are opt-in:

### Autonomous Mode:

An open and free experience for well-adjusted adult users. This setting delivers a full content service, with all United States First Amendment Protected Free Speech. Default network tag filters and thumbnail concealment are disabled, and posts with a negative voting score are displayed normally. Only Hardline tags are in use for filtering.

### Standard Mode: 

A normal and responsible adult experience. Default filtering options for network tags to filter, conceal, and annotate content.

-	#nsfw: Content that is considered to be of an erotic, illicit, or explicit nature, thumbnails are hidden by default.

-	#nsfl: Content that includes graphic gore, injuries, or particularly disgusting visuals. Thumbnails are hidden by default.

-	#spam: Content that is low quality, aimed to waste time and network resources, excessively begs for upvotes, or tips, or is repeatedly promoting some external financial interest of its uploader without adding value. Posts are greyed out by default.

-	#scam: Content that contains phishing links, claims to return a multiple of cryptocurrency sent to an address, promotes an external financial interest that involves multilevel marketing, paying investment returns from later investors, impersonates another account, or otherwise attempts to defraud unsuspecting users. Posts are greyed out by default, and must contain an explanation of the Scam attempt. 

-	#false: Content that is verifiably factually incorrect and intended to mislead users. Posts have a warning sign and question mark by default, and must contain a link to a counterpoint source, as annotated by the tag creator.

-	#shill: Content that is misleading, and overly supportive of a particular agenda to the extent of suspecting that it was made by a compensated political or corporate agent. Posts have a warning sign and a speech bubble with a dollar sign by default, and must contain a link to a counterpoint source explaining the bias of the content.

-	#bot: Content that was created by an automatic program for viewing on WeYouMe. Bot developers should include this tag to notify users that the content is a bot. Posts have a robot icon by default.

-	#spoiler: Content that contains information that reveals sensitive plot points of a popular creative work that was released in the previous 30 days. Thumbnails are hidden by default, and text is blacked out until hovered over.

-	#repost: Content that has been plagiarized or copied from another source without attribution. Posts have a recycle icon by default, and must include a link to the original source of the content.

-	#deleted: Content that has been deleted by its author, and should no longer be displayed in interfaces. Filtered by default.

### Safe Mode: 

A more curated experience for sensitive, and younger users. #nsfw, #nsfl, #spam, and #scam are all filtered by default, instead of greyed out. Anonymous posts are filtered. Only Trusted mediators are displayed in the marketplace. Only businesses and assets with a trust rating of 5+ are displayed in the exchange pairs and product marketplace. Includes some additional filtering tags for speech that is legal, but may be considered undesirable by some users:

-	#discriminatory: Content that makes generalized discriminatory negative remarks about a race or class of people.

-	#trigger: Content that describes a traumatic event and may cause distress to individuals that have experienced similar events.

-	#drugs: Content that contains references to or depictions of UN controlled recreational narcotic substances.

-	#extremism: Content that endorses or promotes: The policies or actions of violent political regimes, violent revolution, genocide, forceful seizing of property, assassination, imprisonment without due process, martial law, or forceful silencing of political dissent.

### Family Mode: 

An experience designed for optimal safety and protection of young children. Anonymous posts are filtered. Includes settings of Safe, plus additional filtering tags that can be self-applied by content creators, or attached by moderators or governance addresses:

-	#nsfc: Explicit content that is not safe for children, but not NSFW.

-	#language: Content that contains explicit language.

-	#scary: Content considered likely to be scary to children under 12.

-	#bullying: Contains hurtful language or insults that may cause distress.

These advanced filtering options also facilitate the protection of brands from being shown on pages with undesirable content, by whitelisting a set of governance addresses that users must follow to be eligible for displaying promoted posts against. 

This user centric filtering system offers an ideal balance of protecting freedom of speech with high content availability and blockchain censorship resistance, while providing powerful filtering tools and a moderation service model. WeYouMe decentralizes the global responsibility for content management, by removing the bottleneck of a central company, or leaning upon unreliable machine learning algorithms to detect problematic content with its current false positives and false negative rates leaving much to be desired, and requiring training from individuals that may have inherent biases. 

# 12.	Decentralized Exchange 

All WeYouMe cryptocurrencies can be traded on the blockchain using the WeYouMe Decentralized Exchange, or DEX. The Decentralized Exchange charges a 0.1% taker-side trading fee for orders. No fees are charged for maker orders. This is to incentivize traders to provide liquidity to the exchange, and create limit orders to aid price discovery.

This exchange trading fee is distributed to network contributors:

- 50%: Network Revenue.
- 25%: Interface that broadcasted the taker’s transaction(s).
- 25%: Interface that broadcasted the maker’s transaction(s).

All other exchanges and decentralized exchange protocols would be able to access the public orderbook of the WeYouMe DEX. They would be able to operate liquidity bridges and replicate the orderbook between WeYouMe and their own exchange for added volume, price discovery and liquidity. WeYouMe will actively engage with partner exchanges to share orderbook liquidity, and offer the ability for partner exchanges to earn a portion of the fees that they generate with WeYouMe trading transactions.

Exchange orders are broadcast to the network, and settled on the blockchain, ensuring that all assets used are held on chain, under the control of the account owner. All assets are listed in a table, sorted by total trading volume in the last 24 hours. The WeYouMe trollbox is accessible from all trading interfaces. All assets are exchangeable for any other directly, however volume would likely be focused around the WeYouMe cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin currency pairs. 

Users would have a variety of advanced order options, including:

-	Exchange Market Order: Trades are matched against the current best offer on the order book. [Consumes limit orders, and charges taker fee.]

-	Exchange Limit Order: Trades are placed on the orderbook at a fixed price. [Fills market orders and incurs no fees.]

-	Margin Market Order: User automatically borrows funds against their margin collateral at the lowest peer to peer interest rate, then purchases another asset at the best market price. [Consumes lending limit orders and exchange limit orders, and charges taker fees on trade and interest.]

-	Margin Limit Order: User borrows funds at a specified interest rate, then purchases another asset at a fixed price on the orderbook. [Fills exchange market orders and lending market orders and incurs no fees.]

-	Lending Limit Order: Offers to lend an asset at a fixed interest rate on the lending orderbook of the asset. Interest rates are listed on a daily rate basis and compounded hourly. [Fills margin market orders and incurs no fees.] 

-	Lending Market Order: Offers to lend an asset at the best market price interest rate. [Consumes margin limit orders and incurs taker fee on interest.]

-	Stop loss order: An exchange market order that is triggered when the price of an asset falls below some predetermined value. [Consumes limit orders, and charges taker fee.]

-	Take profit order: An exchange market order that is triggered when the price of an asset rises above some predetermined value. [Consumes limit orders, and charges taker fee.]

-	Auction Order: Orders to buy or sell an asset with a maximum price for buy orders, and a minimum price for sell orders. Orders are held on the auction order book until the end of each day. Once per day, all auction trades are matched and executed at a single auction price, calculated to ensure the maximum possible volume of trades are completed. Orders that are not cleared are retained for the next day’s auction until cancelled. [Consumes opposite auction orders, incurs no fees]

-	Arbitrage Order: Simultaneously places two limit orders, one to buy for slightly above the current highest bid price, and one to sell the same asset for just below the current lowest ask price. Prices automatically adjust to reflect the current orderbook once every 5 minutes or when one of the orders is filled. Order values are adjusted proportionally when the user’s balance of the assets swings away from equal. [Fills Exchange market orders, incurs no fees]

## 12.1.	User Issued Assets:

User issued assets can be created for free by any account. They can represent any desired assets or measure of value. This could include currencies, shares, equities, derivatives, debt, credit, bonds, tickets, memberships, voting rights, or anything that can be conceptualized and quantified. They can be traded on the blockchain between accounts using exchange orders or transacted between accounts directly for payments. Assets can include an optional creator transaction and trading fee paid to the creator of the asset. User issued assets can be created with functionality to distribute revenue to holders or buy and burn assets using the proceeds of defined income sources. 

User Issued Assets can be set as public or confidential. Public assets show balances and transactions on chain and are traceable. Confidential assets use Stealth addresses, Ring Signatures and Ring Confidential Transactions. Confidential assets do not allow transactions to be traced or balances to be seen.  

User Issued Assets can activate a Bancor protocol relay token, and liquidity pool between itself and MeCoin when created. This allows each asset to always have asynchronous and continuous liquidity with the baseline asset on the decentralized exchange. Relays between other currencies can easily be included into the Liquidity array by the asset creator, and the connection weights can be modified as needed. The exchange orderbook will always complete trades using the best price possible, from either exchange orders, or available liquidity arrays connecting the two assets to be traded. The current exchange rate across all outstanding liquidity arrays are embedded into the orderbook of each trading pair.

Assets can use permission flags to activate certain features for control systems desired by businesses. They can be activated or deactivate as permissions on asset creation, and then enforced when the flag is activated. If a permission is deactivated, the flag cannot be turned on. 

-	Require Whitelist to hold: Only accounts specified in the issuer’s whitelist can hold or receive that asset. Designed to limit asset ownership access to known and trusted parties.

-	Transfers require issuer approval: Only transfers to or from the issuing account are valid, other transactions require the signature of the issuing account to confirm. Designed to limit asset liquidity to facilitate lockup periods. 

-	Require whitelist to trade: Only the issuer, and accounts in the issuer’s whitelist can trade the asset across any exchange pairs. Designed to limit asset exchangeability while allowing payment liquidity. 

-	Limit orders require issuer approval: Only the issuer can place limit orders onto any orderbooks on exchange pairs. Other users must accept prices using market orders. This is designed to restrict secondary market liquidity and allow the asset to be sold without undercutting. 

-	Whitelist exchange pairs: The asset can only be exchanged on market pairs that are in the issuer’s whitelist. Designed to restrict asset liquidity to known and trusted asset exchange pairs, or concentrate orderbook thickness to a smaller set of quote assets. 

-	Disable confidential transfers: No users can send the asset using a confidential transfer. Designed to enforce payment transparency on all asset users. 

-	Disable payment requests: Users cannot send payment requests denominated in this asset, only direct transactions are permitted. Designed to enforce a push only payment model. 

-	Issuer may approve payment requests: The asset issuer may approve payment requests denominated in this asset on behalf of other accounts. Designed to facilitate pull payment characteristics with a central issuing authority, and allows the issuer to recall assets without permission from the holder. 

-	Disable marketplace trades: The asset cannot be used to make marketplace transactions, and cannot be send to mediator multisignature addresses. Designed to restrict marketplace asset usage. 

-	Whitelist marketplace mediators: The asset can only be used for marketplace transactions if all mediators in the multisignature address are in the issuer’s whitelist. Designed to enforce a set of known and trusted mediators. 

-	Editing requires governance approval: The asset details, and flags cannot be changed without the approval of the issuer’s governance address. Designed to limit changes to the asset without oversight from a known and trusted authority. 

-	Issuance requires governance approval: The issuer requires approval from their governance address before being able to issue new units of the asset. Designed to limit printing capability without oversight from a known and trusted authority. 

-	Disable editing: The asset’s characteristics and flags can never be edited after creation. Designed to enforce permanent immutability of the initial asset properties. 

-	Disable asset issuer transfer: The ownership and issuing authority of the asset cannot be transferred to another account. Designed to prevent loss of control over an asset under security breach scenarios. 

## 12.2.	Market Pegged Assets (Smartcoins):

Users are able to issue market pegged assets by vesting MeCoin collateral and borrowing units of Smartcoins. Smartcoins are backed by MeCoin collateral, and are valued according to witness feed valuations. Holders are able to settle these assets and redeem the collateral used to back the assets. Smartcoins are used to track the price of an external asset, such as a fiat currency. The MeUSD is the default smartcoin of WeYouMe, and is used as a medium of exchange. pegged to a settlement price in MeCoin. They are named with the prefix (Me), such as MeUSD = USD, MeBTC = BTC, MeAUD = AUD or MeETH = ETH. 

Network witness officers provide feeds of the settlement prices of these assets in MeCoin, which track the price of their external asset counterparts. Smartcoins can be created to represent any desired external asset, and can be pegged to a settlement price defined by any nominated account, or witness. They can also be pegged to functions of the price of other assets to create index assets, or derivatives. Smartcoin assets can be created that are priced by the inverse of the price of another asset in a specified base asset, allowing an asset to represent a short position on another asset. 

## 12.3.	Miner Issued Assets:

Miner Issued Assets are created by issuing them as a reward to WeYouMe blockchain miners. Each miner issued asset specifies a maximum supply, and a reward decay rate per year. Miner issued assets are created alongside MeCoin when a miner completes a block. Miner issued assets enable users to fairly issue a new asset that inherits the properties and security of MeCoin, without requiring a central issuing account or crowdsale for distribution. Additional value is added to the mining reward when miner issued assets are created.

All miner issued assets supplement the WeYouMe mining reward income to increase the level of proof of work security expenditure, and enable a sound money asset. They can act as a community based store of value and medium of exchange that has a limited supply. This enables an arbitrary number of miner issued assets to utilize the WeYouMe blockchain for free and fast transactions, without needing to compete for proof of work mining power against other coins. Miner issued assets collectively share the MeCoin mining power to secure them. Miners are able to sell them automatically onto the decentralized exchange when the block reward is received.

## 12.4.	Non-Fungible assets:

Non-Fungible Assets are tradable representations of objects on the WeYouMe blockchain. They can hold arbitrary metadata, and can be transferred between users. They are traded on the WeYouMe marketplace, not on the decentralized exchange. Non-fungible assets are sold using the linear reverse auction mechanism, which sets a starting price, and a final price, and decreases the price at a fixed rate until the asset is purchased.

## 12.5.	Liquidity Array Assets (Smart Tokens):

Liquidity Array Assets are created by users to act as the basis of a liquidity array, using the Bancor Protocol. Users can select any number of assets, and assign each asset a connection weight. The array will then use the Bancor formula to price the asset and issue it in response to assets sent into the liquidity array. Liquidity providers can charge an optional fee to make trades into and out of their liquidity array, which increase the value of the assets in the array, and provide a return on investment to all holders of the Liquidity Array Asset. Liquidity array assets include their price for all their connected assets in the orderbook of all connected exchange pairs, and are utilized when they offer the best prices to market participants. By default, all Liquidity Array Assets include a connection to MeCoin, and MeUSD, and have an array fee of 0.1% on taker orders. All arrays can be browsed and directly utilized by searching their name. All arrays are listed in the decentralized exchange in order of 24-hour trading volume, or total liquidity pool asset value.

## 12.6.	Community Issued Assets:

Community Issued Assets are used to provide a stream of unique content rewards for every community. Every board, and group issues its own asset to contributors. Community issued assets can be vested to convey voting power to its holders. They are issued by the board or group blockchain object that they represent. 1 unit of each community issued asset is created in every block, and is distributed to a set of options, with default percentages. Each asset conveys voting power within that community equal to 1 MePower. This gives a 50% split of community post ranking power to holders of WeYouMe voting power assets, and vesting holders of each community’s asset. MeCoin content distribution is not effected by community asset voting power. Users can sort a community’s posts according to a sliding scale of voting weight conveyed to the community asset, and WeYouMe network voting power. By default, this is a 1:1 ratio. 

- 70%: Content rewards - Issued to all content posts in the community, according to votes and views earned. Distributed with a voting power shared between vesting holders of the community asset, and WeYouMe network voting power. 

- 10%: Moderation team - Issued between all elected members of a boards moderation team, according to votes earned from the community members. 

- 10%: Vesting Interest - Issued to all holders of vesting units of the Community asset. 

- 10%: Activity Rewards - Issued equally to all accounts that satisfy an activity reward participation requirement identical to the WeYouMe activity reward, within that community. 

## 12.7.	Gateway Assets:

DEX backed gateway assets are issued to accounts in exchange for deposits of other cryptocurrencies for trading on the Decentralized Exchange. These WeYouMe backed gateway assets are named with the prefix “WYM.”, such as WYM.BCH, WYM.BTC, WYM.AUD, or WYM.ETH. The WeYouMe executive board holds a reserve of other cryptocurrencies that are used to back WeYouMe’s Gateway exchange assets. The balance of these currencies is publicly available on their respective blockchains, and security is independently audited a minimum of once every three months. These reserves allow for high liquidity when entering and leaving the WeYouMe economy via the Decentralized Exchange. Developers can produce third party gateway assets and administrate issuance and redemption where such demand exists. Gateway assets should be named with the prefix of their backing entity. User Issued Assets with a prefix can only be created by the account that created the asset named by the prefix. For example, if an account creates the asset “COIN”, then they could create the asset “COIN.BTC”. 

## 12.8.	Margin Trading:

Traders can use peer to peer lending to borrow funds and execute leveraged margin trades or open short positions. Funds are lent at interest from asset holders wishing to save and earn interest. Any asset can be lent to margin traders with exchange orders to lend and borrow for specified time limits. 

To create margin orders, traders deposit funds into their account’s margin balance. Margin traders must have a collateral margin ratio of at least 20% to open an order, and are force liquidated if their position’s margin drops below the maintenance ratio of 10%. 

Margin traders consume lending limit orders at the lowest interest rate first, and re-borrow at the lowest interest rate when the loan time has expired. Margin limit orders set a specified interest rate and price, which can be filled by market lenders and traders. Limit lenders place lending orders at a specified interest rate, which are consumed by market margin traders. This can optionally be set to automatically update every hour if it does not fill. 

Asset holders that use the savings account functionality in the wallet lend their funds automatically to margin traders with limit lending orders updated hourly. Lending can be disabled to hold savings balances normally. Through this mechanism, savers on the WeYouMe network can earn a market interest rate on any asset that they wish to lend out to traders. In the unlikely event that a margin trader’s short position cannot be force liquidated rapidly enough to prevent a negative margin position, the lender may be covered for default losses by the WeYouMe executive board by reimbursing lost funds with MeCredit issuance. 

## 12.9.	Peer to peer lending:

Peer to peer lending is available between users that wish to lend directly for spending. The credit exchange enables lenders to broadcast offers of credit terms, and attach metadata of eligibility requirements. Borrowers then post applications transactions with metadata related to their creditworthiness, which are reviewed. Applicants are then approved or denied, and are assigned a credit limit of funds that can be used for spending. The borrower may then create payment requests to draw funds from the creditor, which the lender then approves when a matching repayment schedule transaction is signed. 

The debtor signs authorization transactions for future dated recurring payments to the credit account which has a specified rate and frequency, in addition to interest. Borrowers prove creditworthiness to lenders and can provide collateral and personal identification to secure a loan at a lower interest rate. Creditors are advised to diversify their loan portfolio and change interest that is sufficient to cover expected defaults. Due diligence would be essential for lenders to minimize the risk of default. Lenders that are best able to choose viable and solvent borrowers will earn the most interest and suffer the fewest defaults. 

Lenders that do not wish to be responsible for their loan default risk are able to lend to established and trusted credit service provider business accounts that accept default risks and relend at a higher interest rate. 
 
## 12.10.	Option Assets:

Asset holders can create option assets, by locking in balances of their assets for a fixed period of time in their account’s margin balance. Call and put option assets can be created for any asset pair. Locked assets are able to be exchanged at a fixed strike price in another nominated asset for any holders of the options. The options can then be sold for a market price premium on the Decentralized exchange for any asset base pair. Options are dated for expiry on the first day of each month, and each asset is linked to its chain sheet in the exchange. MeCoin and MeUSD will be the primary base pairs of the option chain sheet for every cryptoasset, to enable the consolidation of volume for option asset strike prices, and expiry dates. Option asset trading incurs the same 0.1% fee on the taker side of the trade as regular decentralized exchange trading orders.

## 12.11.	Predictive Split Assets:

Assets can be created by depositing MeCoin into a predictive split asset pool. Predictive split assets can be generated to create a prediction market on any possible future event with a public deterministic outcome. Each unit of MeCoin deposited will return 1 unit relating to each possible option in a predictive scenario outlined by the asset creator. All assets can additionally be deposited back into the predictive split pool to return the associated MeCoin that is held in reserve to back the predictive split assets. 

Each asset will trade at the price corresponding to the market consensus of the probability of that event occurring. At the conclusion of the predictive split asset, the asset corresponding to the realized outcome can be selected by the asset creator. Holders of the correct outcome asset are able to exchange their units of predictive assets for the MeCoin in the asset pool after 7 uncontested days. The asset creator earns trading fees on all exchange trades of their Predictive Split Asset. 

Asset creators are able to post an asset bond to guarantee that they will select the correct outcome. If the asset creator does not select the correct outcome, a challenge bond can be posted to start a poll as to the correct outcome for the asset. All users can then privately vote in a quadratic expenditure election for the correct outcome. Users post voting bonds in MeCoin, and receive voting power for that election equal to their voting bond squared. After 7 days, the option with the majority of voting support is selected for the predictive asset outcome, and all funds that voted in support of opposing options are distributed to the majority voters according to funds posted in their voting bonds squared. If the creator of the predictive asset chose an incorrect outcome, their asset bond is forfeited, and distributed between voters and the challenge bond poster. If the same outcome is selected by the asset creator and the voters, the challenge bond is forfeited to the asset creator and the correct voters. Users should ensure that they invest funds in assets with creators that post large asset bonds for assurance of legitimacy. 

# 13.	WeYouMe Marketplace:

The WeYouMe marketplace consists of created by WeYouMe accounts that facilitate the exchange of Goods and services in exchange for any WeYouMe network cryptocurrency. 

The marketplace charges a 2% fee from the seller of the product or service. This fee is distributed between the mediators and the network.

- 35%: Network Revenue
- 15%: Buyer’s Interface
- 15%: Seller’s Interface
- 10%: Buyers Mediator
- 10%: Seller’s Mediator
- 15%: 3 Selected mediators (5% each)

Each post is made to a store, which is the marketplace equivalent of a board. Stores are moderated by their creators, and can be related to a particular type of product, service, or location. When each product or service is purchased, it opens a sale transaction using a multisignature address between the buyer’s and the seller’s accounts. The buyer securely transmits the shipping details to the seller by encrypting them, and including them in the mediation transaction.

## 13.1.	Dispute resolution system:

Delivery of goods and services is moderated by an escrow system. An address is created that requires multi signature verification to spend funds. They buyer sends funds into the escrow account to initiate the purchase. After confirming the buyer’s payment, the seller ships the goods, or provides the service. The seller then notifies the buyer and mediators that they have shipped the product or provided the service, with evidence. Mediators then create a transaction spending the escrowed funds to the seller’s account, and pay network and mediation fees. The buyer then confirms that the product has been delivered or the service completed to the mediators. 

Marketplace customers and vendors can either choose to use single mediator that they both agree on, or a multi-party mediation team for additional security when they cannot agree on a mediator. The multi-party mediation team consists of seven mediators, one chosen by the buyer, one chosen by the seller, and five chosen at random. 

Once the buyer and seller are satisfied, they both sign one of the mediator’s transactions to spend the funds. When published by a mediator, the transaction is completed, and the payment is released to the seller. Depending on which mediators created and signed the transaction to transfer funds, the buyer and seller sign an additional transaction to pay specific or all mediators their portion of fees. Bonds posted by the buyer, seller and mediators are all refunded.

The buyer, the seller, and each of the mediators post a security bond of 10% of the transaction value to create the multi-signature address. If the transaction process occurs normally and is signed by both the buyer and the seller, this bond is refunded. If one does not sign, and a dispute occurs, the security bonds of the party at fault, and their supporting mediators is split between the winners of the dispute, and the mediators in support of the winner. 

All the mediators that vote on the side that is successful divide the fees amongst themselves, whereas accounts that vote against the consensus and risk losing their transaction bond and mediation fees. This drives mediators to reach a consensus on the truth of what happened, and to avoid colluding to defraud customers and other mediators. Each mediators does not want to be involved in disputed transactions, due to the time and effort required to resolve them, and the permanent negative public image.

Fraudulent traders and mediators will lose their security bond, are likely to be rated negatively by the other accounts involved, and are recorded on the blockchain as having been the guilty party to a disputed transaction conflict. This should cause customers and mediators to distrust them in the future, and result in a loss of future sales and an inability to find a representing mediator due to the potential for fraud. Mediators always have more to lose from fraud than they have to gain, due to the potential loss of income and security bond when brought to a mediator trial.

Default transactions are overseen by 7 mediators, one is chosen by the buyer, and one is chosen by the seller. The user’s advocate mediators have double the voting power in dispute resolutions, and promote the interests of the account that chose them. 

Advocate mediators receive double the share in the mediator fees paid by the transaction. In multi-party mediation, a minimum weight of 11 is required to sign a disputed transaction over to an account. This requires either the buyer, the seller, and a majority of the mediators in a disputed transaction. 

All marketplace transactions use multi-signature addresses, that must be signed by a threshold of accounts with the following weights assigned to different parties:

### Multi-party mediation team (default):

- Buyer: 5
- Seller: 5
- Buyer’s advocate mediator: 2
- Seller’s advocate mediator: 2
- Network Selected Mediator A: 1
- Network Selected Mediator B: 1
- Network Selected Mediator C: 1

### Single mediator transaction (optional when viable):
- Buyer: 5
- Seller: 5
- Mutually agreed mediator: 1

For standard marketplace trades, the transaction must be signed by all parties and mediators. The transaction sends the payment to the seller, returns all bonds to their owners, and pays fees accordingly. Every transaction, before initiating, sets an amount of time that the transaction has to be settled, by default this is seven days, and should be set to slightly longer than the maximum amount of time that delivery or task completion should take. If in this time the seller has failed to provide the product, or the buyer claims that it has not been received, the transaction enters a contested state. After the expiry of the standard time period, the amount of weight required to sign the transaction spend is reduced by 1 per day, from 17 down to a minimum of 9. Single mediator transactions require 11 initially, lowering down to 6 when disputed.

It is in the interest of mediators to provide good customer service, and earn a high reputation for fairness in dispute resolution, in order to be chosen by a large base of fee paying customers. 

## 13.2.	Mediators:

Accounts can become mediators by obtaining profile account verification, and posting a transaction adding their account to the mediator pool. This transaction includes a collateral deposit, called the mediator security bond, of at least 10 MeCoin. Larger mediator bonds allow selection in higher value transactions and are advisable. Mediator security bonds are withdrawn with a 7-day delay after leaving the mediation pool.

This collateral deposit is used to fund transaction bonds to create each multi signature address. Mediators can only be selected for transactions that have a sale value of less than their mediator security bond. 

Mediators are required to sign transactions that return the bonds back to each party, and split mediator fees accurately. If specific parties refuse to sign due to transaction issues, a lower threshold is required each day, allowing the majority to sign the transaction and distribute fees and the security bonds of the non-signing parties. If fraud occurs, the buyer and mediators can create a transaction to spend the funds to their verdict of buyer or seller. The transaction bonds of parties who side with the minority verdict are forfeited to the majority. 

It is the responsibility of the two appointed mediators to craft proposed transactions to resolve the dispute, and for all other parties to agree by signing the transactions, or stating opposition to them. The first party to obtain a majority wins the dispute. 

When a transaction becomes disputed, all transaction communication logs are publicly posted to the mediator’s board for community oversight of the practices of the buyer, seller, and mediators. Any wrongdoing, threats, game theory collusion to split bonds among fraudulent mediators, or other evidence of malpractice by any party is on public display if a transaction becomes disputed. 

Mediators cannot be selected randomly that are connections with any other mediator, and active mediators cannot send new connection requests while in a transaction. Mediators that are involved in a disputed transaction cannot be selected for another transaction. 

In all cases, it is in the interest of mediators to be truthful and legitimate. It is more profitable to have a strong record as a good mediator and become chosen more often than it is to extract short term gains through fraud. 

Overall, it is in the interest of mediators to ensure the reliability and integrity of the WeYouMe escrow system, to increase sales volume, and their fee income. 

## 13.3.	Mediator trials:

If mediators sign fraudulent transactions, they are on the record, on their verified account, as having committed fraud. If a mediator is discovered to have committed fraud, they can be reported to the network in the mediator board. If a voting power equal to 30 average accounts, from at least 30 individual accounts supports the report, the mediator report is approved. 

Mediator report posts must contain evidence of fraud. Approved mediator reports create a vote post, called a mediator trial, whereby all active mediators can place a vote with weight based on the value of their mediation security bond, to apply a penalty to the account. Meditator trials are supported by 25% of the security bond of the accusing mediators account, which is forfeited if the final verdict is not guilty. 

After seven days, the most supported option is declared, and enforced by the blockchain. It is up to mediators to determine the policies by which they choose to vote, and which penalties they choose to support:

-	Not Guilty: Report is discarded and mediator is free to continue, accusing mediator loses report bond.
-	Minor Fraud: 30-day suspension from mediation queue and 25% security bond loss.
-	Moderate Fraud: 90-day suspension from mediation queue and 50% security bond loss.
-	Severe Fraud: Permanent removal from mediation queue and 100% security bond loss.

All lost security bonds from mediator trials are awarded to the security bond of the winning party. They can also be used to provide refunds to the defrauded customers and mediators, at the accusing mediator’s discretion. 

Responsible and High-quality mediators should make public refund guarantees, and refund customers immediately in the event of fraud. They would then pursue compensation in a mediator trial. The record of the refund payment would be viewed favorably by the mediator community in mediator trials, to prove that the customer is their priority, and that the mediator is legitimate.

## 13.4.	Product posts:

The Marketplace page in WeYouMe applications displays Product, Service, Commission, and Task posts from all users, and allows posts to be searched. 

-	Product Posts: Contain details regarding the objects being sold. Includes an image album, multiple tags to categorize the product, and a pricing structure (Fixed, wholesale discounting, or auction type), product location, and shipping details. 

-	Service Posts: Contain details of a service being sold. Includes an image album, multiple tags to categorize the service, a pricing structure (Milestone based, Hourly, or Fixed rate), an operating area, and availability times. 

-	Commission Posts: Contain details of an object desired for production. Includes a description of the desired object, multiple tags to categorize the commission, a pricing structure (Milestone based, Hourly, or Fixed rate), delivery location, and shipping details. Commission providers then bid on the post, then the submitter chooses which applicant to assign the commission to.

-	Task Posts: Contain details of a task desired for completion. Includes an image album, multiple tags to categorize the task, a pricing structure guideline (Milestone based, Hourly, or Fixed rate), a task location, and timeline requirements. Service providers are then able to bid on the task post, and the submitter chooses which applicants to assign the task to.

Posts are recorded on the blockchain, where they can be accessed, and listed for purchase by external applications. Sales are recorded on the WeYouMe blockchain, and signed by the buyer, seller, and the mediators optionally chosen by the accounts or randomly assigned from the mediator pool. 

Buyers, sellers, and mediators are reviewed by customers in every interaction and have an approval score out of 100. Merchants with products and services for sale on the WeYouMe blockchain can use an API to create simple payment buttons on their own applications. 

## 13.5.	Stores:

Store pages list all the products and services that businesses or users have for sale. Stores contain Product, Service, Task and Commission posts, and they can be limited to a selected group of accounts, or open for public listings depending on the type of store. 

-	Open Store: Products can be listed by any accounts and browsed by any accounts. Products are automatically approved for listing but can be removed by store moderators.

-	Public Store: Products can only be listed by approved accounts and browsed by any accounts. Products must be approved by board moderators before submission.

-	Private Store: Products can only be listed by approved accounts and browsed by approved customers. All customers can apply for admission into the store. 

-	Secret Store: Products can only be listed by approved accounts and browsed by approved customers. Products and store details are not visible in search. Customers and Sellers must be invited into the store before browsing or listing.

Stores can optionally require that the products pay a percentage of the sale price to the creator of the store they are bought from. Products listed on WeYouMe can also optionally return a percentage of their revenue to all tags that link to the product, according to their content rewards earned. 

Product posts can use a variety of pricing method to sell products, including:

-	Fixed price sales: Seller chooses one price and sells products only at that price. Used for commodity products. 

-	Wholesale price sales: Seller chooses a base price, and can specify discounts to apply when a certain threshold of products are purchased.

-	Auctions: Seller chooses a reserve price, and a duration. Bids are made publicly in increasing order until the auction is finished, and the product is sold to the highest bidder. Used for high value non-fungible products. 

-	Reverse Auctions: Seller chooses a starting price, which reduces linearly to a minimum price over a set duration until it is purchased. Used for lower value non-fungible products. 

-	Secret Auctions: Seller lists a product, and accepts bids for a set duration. Bids are made secretly. The highest bidder pays the price offered by the second highest bidder. Used for very subjectively priced non-fungible products. 

Service, Commission, and Task posts can use a variety of pricing systems:

-	Hourly Pricing: Charges an allocated amount per hour. A budget value is placed in escrow, which is paid to the multisignature address. Buyer and seller agree on hours to be invoiced after completion.
 
-	Milestone Pricing: Service providers and bidders to task and commission posts select a range of at least 2 milestones for payment targets. All milestone payments are placed in escrow, and when each milestone task is completed, the seller requests payment, and the buyer accepts and the payment is released.  

-	Fixed Pricing: Charges a fixed price that is paid after the service or task has been completed, or the commission product has been delivered. 

## 13.6.	Recurring Payments:

Businesses and Applications that sell ongoing services can setup regular transactions with customers to pay a fixed amount periodically. This transaction references a valid payment authorization transaction from the payer, which allows an amount to be spent from an address to another defined address once per a predetermined number of blocks. If the amount is greater than the authorized limit, or a payment has used the authorization more frequently than allowed, the transaction is invalid and will not be propagated by the nodes.

This allows buyers to opt in to a direct debit style transaction mechanism for recurring expenses without having to directly authorize each one. Delivery of goods can be purchased from integrated delivery businesses, multiple payment options can be accepted using integrated currency exchanging services, which purchase MeUSD with the currency used, and then relay the payment to the seller. 

## 13.7.	Marketplace Credit:

Users are able to establish a line of credit with a lender on the decentralized exchange, which can be extended at the point of sale to pay for purchases. A credit authorization transaction enables another account to access peer to peer lending instantly for WeYouMe marketplace transactions, up to a specified credit limit value, at a specified interest rate, and with a specified payment schedule. When the loan is issued, a recurring repayment schedule is authorized to repay funds over a specified time period. Creditors should ensure that they conduct due diligence on borrowers to ensure an acceptable level of default risk. Peer to peer lenders are advised to diversify their loan portfolios, charge adequate interest rates to cover expected defaults, and ensure that credit limits are set to acceptable risk levels. 

## 13.8.	Wishlist:

Each account can add product posts to their wishlist, in order to save them for later viewing and purchasing. When a user sets a product to their wishlist, it can be private, which encrypts the content of the wishlist to being only visible by the user, or public, which can be viewed by the network. 

Products in a user’s public wishlist can then be bought on behalf of that user, and delivered to their desired shipping address by other accounts on the network. This make it simple to purchase gifts for other users, and allows for content creators to have gifts bought for them by dedicated users from the marketplace. Items on the user’s public wishlist are also able to be used for selection of promoted content, and discounts can be offered if the seller knows that the user wants an item, but has not bought it yet.

# 14.	WeYouMe Business Ecosystem:

In the final stages of the development of WeYouMe, Business accounts will have access to several capital market features, facilitated by the WeYouMe decentralized exchange, and WeYouMe Consortium, with the objective of building a strong network effect and collaborative environment for founders and enterprise participants to build upon. 

Business account owners on WeYouMe will have a pathway to growth:

1.	Secure Cryptoequity offering as a capital raising solution.
2.	Joining and participating in the WeYouMe Consortium.
3.	Raising late stage capital from the WeYouMe Investment Fund.

## 14.1.	Secure Cryptoequity Offering:

WeYouMe Business accounts can facilitate capital raising by offering some or all of their cryptoequity asset to the public using a Secure Cryptoequity Offering (SCO). Investors are able to send funds to the offering address for a predetermined amount of time to receive allocations of cryptoassets, with the following properties:

-	Soft cap: A minimum threshold of capital that must be raised overall for the offering to succeed, otherwise all contributors are refunded. 

-	Hard cap: A maximum value that can be raised.

-	Minimum contribution: the lowest value that an address can contribute.

-	Maximum contribution: the highest value that an account can contribute.

-	Quantity Bonus Factor: A percentage factor that multiplies the amount of assets received, based on the logarithm (base ten) of the amount contributed, divided by the minimum contribution. For each factor of 10 increase, a percentage bonus is linearly incremented. [Example: QBF = 1%, minimum contribution = 1 MEC – User that contributes 10 MEC

-	Governance address: A nominated address of a supervising entity that must co-sign all expenditures of the funds within the capital pool after the offering is complete.

-	Milestone schedule: A set of specific, measurable objectives that must be completed before thresholds of funds can be spent from the capital pool, that are tracked by the asset holders and the governance address. Each milestone has an associated percentage of the capital pool that can be spent when complete.

-	Liquidity Time: An integer number of hours after the funding event finishes, after which the trading of the asset commences on all DEX asset pairs, and transactions can be sent between addresses. Until this time transfers and trades are frozen. 

Auction or Base: Selection between auction style, or instant base rate style. 

Auction Parameters [Offers a fixed amount per event divided proportionally between contributors at completion, unknown price]:

-	Total Issuance: The total number of asset units to be distributed.

-	Auction quantity: The integer number of auction events to occur.

-	Auction duration: The integer number of hours that each auction event lasts for. 

-	Time bonus Factor: The percentage factor that the supply offered by each subsequent auction event is reduced by, to provide a lower initial price at a continuously increasing rate.

Base Parameters [Offers a direct and instant purchase at a predetermined price, unknown quantity]:

-	Maximum Issuance: The maximum number of cryptoassets issued during the offering.

-	Base Price: The Base price in MeCoin per unit of CryptoAsset sold. 

-	Offering Timeframe: An integer number of hours for the offering to last for.

-	Time bonus Rate: The percentage bonus in assets received at the beginning of the offering, linearly reducing down to zero over the offering timeframe.

14.2	The WeYouMe Consortium:

Business accounts can become sponsored by the WeYouMe community to join the WeYouMe consortium, and receive the following benefits:

-	Inclusion of businesses cryptoequity and cryptocredits in the WeYouMe investment fund portfolio, and ability to propose funding from the WeYouMe Community Enterprise Fund.

-	Ability to receive MeCredit default reimbursement for asset holders.

-	Direct line of contact with the WeYouMe Executive board, core development team, and network officers.

-	Incorporation on the blockchain as a WeYouMe Endorsed Business on initiation, and as a WeYouMe Consortium Member after confirmation.
 
-	Support from the WeYouMe executive board’s legal team, and the WeYouMe Advocacy Officers in cases of legal liability.

-	A prominent badge next to the business name everywhere it appears on www.weyoume.io and in all WeYouMe marketing material as a WeYouMe Endorsed Business during preliminary membership, and a WeYouMe Consortium Member after confirmation.

-	The ability to advertise in the daily activity reward pool distribution transaction message.

-	Invitations to WeYouMe network meetings and presentations during the WeYouMe Festival.

### Business Sponsorship process:

Business accounts can join the WeYouMe Consortium by applying to the WeYouMe Executive Board for an admittance election. Applying business accounts must fulfil the following criteria for consideration by the network. 

-	The business produces or administrates a working marketable product or application that utilizes the WeYouMe network for infrastructure or sales.

-	The business has publicly known executives and developers, that all have WeYouMe verified profile accounts.

-	The business has issued a cryptoasset or cryptocredit on the WeYouMe decentralized exchange that returns a minimum of 5% of the business account’s revenue to investors or creditors. 

-	The business has strong transparency regarding all expenditures of funds from its public wallets on all cryptocurrency blockchains, whereby it discloses all addresses and funds controlled, and adequately explains all expenditures over 0.25% of their net funds with a public memo recorded on the WeYouMe blockchain. 

-	The business discloses the source code and uses open source licensing for the majority of any software produced. 

-	The business conducts a sharedrop of their Cryptoequity onto the WYM asset of at least 1% of their total issuance. 

If 51% of the WeYouMe network voting power supports their admittance, they can join as a preliminary member. After 1 year of business activities, community engagement, positive involvement in the cryptocurrency space, and transparency of their business operations, a confirmation election is conducted. If 67% of the WeYouMe network voting power supports the sponsorship of the business, they are confirmed as Consortium members. 

### Consortium Default Security: 

In any instance where a WeYouMe consortium business declares a default, it has the opportunity to be backed up by the WeYouMe network to make its investors whole. All WYM holders can vote to reimburse the default of a WeYouMe endorsed business. Upon consensus by the network, the entity in default will be supported by the liquidation of all outstanding cryptoequities at a specified price and cryptocredits at face value for an equivalent amount of MeCredit. 

Each MeCredit is worth 1 MeUSD in revenue from the WeYouMe network. They are repaid through being rebought by the WeYouMe revenue distribution system when their market value falls below 1 MeUSD, until no more remain on exchanges being sold at or under 1 MeUSD each. They maintain value by earning interest at a rate determined by the Witness Officers. This effectively pays back defaulted investors from the protocol revenue of the WeYouMe network.

This allows business defaults to be repaid to investors without intervention in the immutability of the blockchain with redistribution hardforks. This protection for businesses and investors allows for a degree of confidence and assurance to promote growth, and stability. The decision to reimburse a sponsored business’s stakeholders is executed by a vote of the network when the business has made a sufficiently extensive effort to repay debts, but are provably unable to, due to events outside the control of the business and not the result of negligence or incompetence. 

## 14.3.	WeYouMe Investment Fund:

The WeYouMe Investment Fund is a Liquidity Array Asset used by to invest in the WeYouMe business ecosystem. It acts as a passive index fund that holds a portfolio in all WeYouMe sponsored businesses, WeYouMe network currencies, and selected external cryptocurrencies. Ownership is represented by the cryptoasset or (Smart Token) WYMFUND, which corresponds to an ownership claim on the cryptocredit and cryptoequity of WeYouMe’s sponsored businesses, with liquidity connections to all WeYouMe supported cryptocurrencies. All assets included in the fund will utilize a continuous liquidity exchange system, that enables any included asset to be traded for WYMFUND automatically, without requiring a counterparty on the DEX. It holds a reserve balance of each asset, and enables trades between the assets. 

The WeYouMe Investment Fund will use the Bancor formula set to price the issuance of new WYMFUND units when assets are exchanged into the contract. WYMFUND will be presented prominently in the decentralized exchange and is the asset officially recommended, endorsed, and promoted by the Executive board of WeYouMe for long term investment in the growth of both WeYouMe and the global cryptocurrency economy. All currencies will have continuous asynchronous and zero-spread liquidity to the WYMFUND Smart Token asset, and by extension, all other included assets. The WeYouMe investment fund will utilize an array token contract with the following connection weights:

WeYouMe Cryptocurrencies (30%):

- 7.5% - WYM
- 7.5% - MeCoin
- 7.5% - MeUSD
- 7.5% - MeCredit

WeYouMe Gateway assets (30%):
Allocation subject to change according to vote of the WeYouMe Executive board.

- 2.5% - WYM.BTC – Bitcoin
- 2.5% - WYM.BCH – Bitcoin Cash
- 2.5% - WYM.BSV – Bitcoin SV
- 2.5% - WYM.BTS - Bitshares
- 2.5% - WYM.STEEM – Steem
- 2.5% - WYM.EOS - EOS
- 2.5% - WYM.ETH - Ethereum
- 2.5% - WYM.ETC – Ethereum Classic
- 2.5% - WYM.XMR - Monero
- 2.5% - WYM.DASH - Dash
- 2.5% - WYM.ZEC - ZCash
- 2.5% - WYM.BNT – Bancor Network Token

WeYouMe Sponsored Business Cryptoequities (40%):

Divided according to market capitalization between the Cryptoequities and Cryptocredits (3:1) of all Sponsored businesses that are included in the WeYouMe Consortium. 

WYMFUND regularly pays out its returns from interest and revenue distributions in MeCoin to its holders. Units of the fund can be created by sending any component assets to the smart contract. The reverse occurs when units of WYMFUND are sent back the smart contract. They are destroyed, and then their component assets are sent to the seller. The amount of WYMFUND issued to incoming asset contributors varies with the relative supplies of each unit using the Bancor formula.

# 15.	WeYouMe Governance Structure:

The WeYouMe network operates a governance structure for the administration of the network, while maintaining a strong separation of powers and limitations. Significant checks and balances are imposed to ensure competent and valuable leadership. The network is able to function entirely without a central authority, and few functions are operated by elected officers. Officers can be replaced rapidly by network stakeholders, creating competitive pressures to act in the interests of the network. 

## 15.1.		WeYouMe Network Officers:

The top 50 voted accounts of the Witness, Marketing, Development, and Advocate pools, the top 50 Mining accounts, and the 20 members of the executive board make up a 270-person body, collectively called the WeYouMe Network Officers. WeYouMe officers hold no power over the issuance of MeCoin or WYM. They have no ability to infringe the immutability of the blockchain, and shall never execute a hard-fork to censor addresses or transactions. Votes can be instantly and freely changed at any time, enabling accountability on a minute by minute basis. 

## 15.2.		WeYouMe Executive Board:

The WeYouMe Executive board is elected by the holders of WYM, according to balance weight. All positions are elected by weighted transferable vote instances for each position. Holders of WYM vote for their top 10 selections for each position, and the top candidate is the selected officer. 

Once elected into a position, the Executive officer is then able to hold the position for a timeframe of 3 years, before new votes can be cast on that position. After 3 years, the position is able to be filled by a new officer, if more voting power is allocated to a new officer candidate. Any WYM holder that does not vote has their voting weight added to the votes of their supported witnesses, who vote on their behalf. 

Each executive officer selects a deputy of their choice to act on their behalf and to assume their position in unforeseen circumstances. Deputy officers must be approved by the CEO. This creates 20 total Executive board positions. Accounts can only apply for one executive officer role at a time.

To be eligible for election as a WeYouMe Executive Officer or deputy, applicants must:

-	Have a Verified Profile Account.

-	Hold a minimum balance of 10 WYM.

-	Have an account that is at least 12 months old.

-	Be approved by at least 2 current Witness officers.

-	Be approved by at least 2 current Executive officers.

Executive board roles are full time positions, and are compensated with a salary from the WeYouMe network, paid in MeCredit. All WeYouMe executive officers are designated as a signing authority to the weyoume main account. This enables them to propose and accept transactions, which must be accepted by 3 of 10 officers or their deputies. 

For a variety of functions, specific executive officers must concur:

-	For MeCredit issuance, dismissing executive officers, and appointing deputy officers, the CEO must approve.

-	For payments, the CFO must approve. 

-	For posts, the CMO must approve. 

-	For network node version upgrade declarations, the CDO must approve.
 
-	For governance address functions, the CGO must approve.

All elected WeYouMe executive officers hold Top Level membership while in their position. Executive salaries are determined by witness parameters. All witness feeds are averaged to calculate the salary. The total value of executive board salaries is capped to a specified value worth of MeCoin. This cap requires a network vote with 51% voting power support to alter. This ensures that Executive board members have a direct financial incentive to increase the value of MeCoin.

If the value of MeCredit or MeUSD falls below $0.90 USD, all members of the executive board are ineligible for re-election. If the value of MeCredit falls below $0.80, creation of MeCredit is frozen by the network, and executive salaries are suspended. Executives are paid in MeCredit to ensure that they do not issue excessive amounts of debt against the WeYouMe network revenue, as any devaluation in MeCredit will reduce the value and sell-side liquidity of their own salaries. MeCredit maintains value when the creditworthiness of the WeYouMe network is high, and the network earns consistent revenue to repurchase them from the Decentralized Exchange faster than they are issued.

# 16.	WeYouMe Predecessors: 

The feature set of WeYouMe is influenced by many great products that were created before it. WeYouMe is transparent about its predecessors and is open to collaboration with them all to deliver great user experiences. 

All cryptocurrencies included here will have full non-custodial wallet functionality included in the WeYouMe.io and mobile interfaces. Their assets will have trading functionality on the WeYouMe Decentralized exchange, with gateway assets will be operated by the WeYouMe company in collaboration with their development teams. 

## 16.1.		Steem (STEEM | www.steemit.com):

The primary inspiration for WeYouMe is the Steem blockchain ecosystem. Steem enables users to make public facing blog posts to its blockchain, and pioneered the user voting based cryptocurrency reward distribution mechanism. Steem stores the text of its posts on its blockchain, but relies on centralized file hosts to store multimedia files, such as images and videos. Decentralized solutions, such as Dtube, Dsound, and Dlive were created to enable new interfaces specialized for the hosting of media content including videos, audio, and livestreams. These make posts to the Steem blockchain, earning creator’s rewards, and hosting the files on IPFS. All content posted to these Decentralized platforms that use IPFS will be easily cross posted to the WeYouMe Blockchain, where they can all be viewed in the same interface. Steem has the highest transactions per second of any blockchain in production, and offers free transactions, with rate limiting based on stake. This model allows all users to easily interact with the blockchain, without incurring transactions fees. It’s primary Interface www.steemit.com serves all posted Steem content to users for free, while specialized interfaces are able to list themselves as post beneficiaries in transactions to earn a small share from the content rewards of their users. Steem has been highly successful in its first few years of operation, and Steemit is in the top 1500 most popular websites in the United States.

## 16.2.		Bitshares (BTS | www.bitshares.org):

The Bitshares Decentralized exchange is the original implementation of Graphene. It offers an easy to use platform for the trading of User issued assets, with popular exchange service providers such as Openledger and CryptoBridge running Gateway assets for exchange on the Bitshares blockchain. The on-chain decentralized exchange operates effectively, with low trading fees, and rapid block times. Bitshares enables the creation of smartcoins that are backed by Bitshares collateral. This allows for the holding of fiat pegged value without relying on a central counterparty. Bitshares operates a worker proposal system, that funds the completion of specific tasks when they reach a voting threshold. Bitshares has the largest volume of any decentralized exchange due to its ease of use, multiple interface implementations, and its low trading fees compared to other decentralized exchanges.

## 16.3.		Bitcoin (BTC: www.bitcoin.org | BCH: www.bitcoincash.org| BSV: www.bitcoinsv.io ):

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin pioneered the blockchain model of transaction storage, propagation and security. The blockchain design enabled the creation of immutable public data storage, which when combined with the Proof of Work mechanism, allowed anyone around the world to secure the blockchain, while rewarding those that contribute hashing power. Proof of work enabled currency to be distributed fairly, and provides the basis for achieving decentralized consensus about the state of the transaction output set. In 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain separated into the Bitcoin Core blockchain (BTC), and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain (BCH) out of a failure to achieve consensus about how to scale the network. Bitcoin (Cash) has achieved a strong level of transaction throughput, and has made advances in the difficulty adjustment algorithm, preventing instability in the case of large hashing power declines. Bitcoin core however has not maintained the same level of transaction throughput, and has sustained extended periods of high fee costs and slow unreliable transaction times. The WeYouMe project recognizes the importance of low fees, and fast reliable transaction times, and goes further to provide free transactions with fast confirmations using Delegated proof of stake. WeYouMe supports on chain scaling, which is the key to its operational model. 

## 16.4.		Ethereum (ETH | www.ethereum.org):

Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to offer smart contract functionality. It enables a Turing complete smart contract language called solidity to be used for the creation of code that is uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain. Other Ethereum accounts can interact with smart contracts to move funds according to the contract code, and store state information. Ethereum enables ERC20 tokens, which can be issued upon receipt of Ethereum into a smart contract address. This process is widely used to operate Initial Coin Offerings. Ethereum, however, has significant transaction fees and limitations to its scalability when under heavy usage. 

## 16.5.		Decent (DCT | www.decent.ch):

Decent utilizes a blockchain model to link content storage to the Bittorrent protocol, and provide content distribution. Files can be encrypted for sale from their authors, when payment is received in DCT. Encryption keys are held by publishers, which earn a fee for distributing decryption keys to users, and hold sharded redundant pieces of the key for distribution to its purchasers. This offers a highly decentralized and resilient platform for distributing files. 

## 16.6.		Facebook (www.facebook.com): 

Currently the most popular social media platform in the world, Facebook offers users and extensive range of features, including profile pages, friends restricted posting, business or interest pages, groups, and event pages. With over 2,000,000,000 active users worldwide, Facebook fares a near complete adoption rate in the developed world. Its early success over Myspace and Friendster is commonly attributed to its platform stability, reliability, content control mechanisms, and consistent deployment of new features. Additionally, Facebook leveraged the ecosystem of third party developers to produce add on applications for users. The event page feature offers significant advantages to any event managers, and promoters. Communication with all attendees, and virulent exposure when friends notify that they are attending provide a strong standard for planning and management. Links to purchase tickets also allow commercial operators to market their event to new customers. For all of these reasons, Facebook became a global powerhouse and standard of social media. 

## 16.7.		YouTube (www.youtube.com): 

As the largest video streaming platform in the world, YouTube offers users the ability to subscribe to their favorite content creators, and to receive video recommendations based on machine learning algorithms. Creators receive advertising revenue based on the amount of watch time their videos receive, and additionally receive revenue shared from the amount of watch time from YouTube Red subscribers. The Premium membership offers access to exclusive content, and removes platform advertising. With over 1,500,000,000 active users worldwide, YouTube offers one of the most profitable platforms for content creators to earn revenue from their audience. 

## 16.8.		Snapchat (www.snapchat.com):

Snapchat enables users to send image messages or videos directly to contacts, and deletes all images once opened, unless saved. Upon interacting with friends daily, a streak counter displays the amount of consecutive days that pictures (snaps) have been exchanged. Users can additionally post images and videos to a story, where they are visible to all following accounts for up to 24 hours. These features combine to form an ecosystem where content can be created and shared instantly, and no content is publicly archived for long term viewing. This drives an in-the-moment mentality, where trivial and fun content is shared daily. Images can also be altered with facial recognition to produce special effects or location specific graphics using filters and lenses. With over 150 million active daily users, Snapchat earns revenue from advertisements that are displayed intermittently, and from charging for sponsored filters and lenses. 

## 16.9.		Patreon (Patreon.com):

Patreon offers the ability for creators to post multimedia content to their Patrons, which pay a monthly subscription fee of any amount they choose. The highest paying subscribers have access to the most exclusive content. Patreon has become a valuable resource for content creators to supplement their advertising revenue, and to provide financing for incredibly high quality video content. By enabling users to choose a patron subscription amount, and offering scaling benefits with the amount of value provided, Creators are able to flexibly cater their focus towards their most loyal and supportive fans, while delivering a broad base of free content to attract new Patrons. 

## 16.10.	Yours (www.yours.org):

Yours provides a platform for blogging that enables users to vote for posts with Bitcoin (SV), and to optionally require payment to access a premium portion of content posted. Yours posts additionally require a small payment in BSV to create, and have the option of charging a small fee to comment on the post. This small payment required to create posts and comments creates an effective mechanism to disincentivize low quality content, and unnecessary posting. This raises the signal to noise ratio of the platform considerably. Yours has no advertising, and instead earns income by charging users to post, and from receiving a share of funds used to upvote content.

## 16.11.	OpenBazaar (www.openbazaar.org):

OpenBazaar allows merchants to list products for sale on a peer to peer marketplace. Sales have no fees, and the project is operated as a non-profit open source organization. Users can choose a moderator to oversee each transaction, and use a multi-signature wallet to escrow funds. Users can setup stores with product information, manage inventory, and access encrypted peer to peer messaging. Funds are transferred using only cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash are accepted as payment to merchants, with ShapeShift used to accept many other coins. 

# 17.		Business Plan:

WeYouMe will execute the development of its product by focusing heavily on key aspects of the Decentralized Autonomous Corporation’s composition. 

## 17.1.		User Experience:

At WeYouMe, the user experience is the heart of our product. WeYouMe will make using blockchain technology easy for everyone. WeYouMe is owned and operated by users, and they are the network’s first imperative. Users will have the ability to customize their experience to suit their needs. 

Post sorting algorithms will be transparently defined, and have a high degree of user customizability. Users can filter any type of content they choose, and can engage with their friends in new ways using groups and events with built in cryptocurrency payments. WeYouMe’s private encrypted messaging can be used to send and receive pictures with optional deletion.

All types of media will be able to be hosted on the WeYouMe network, meaning that there can be a community for anything desired by the world. Users can choose whether to use a profile account with their full identity or use a persona account to portray any pseudonym they choose. Anonymous users can post any content, without any concerns for identity tracing. This can enable all WeYouMe users to speak their minds freely.

Content creators can earn revenue from the blockchain for their work, and can earn from their viewers through tips, premium content purchases, and subscription contributions. They can raise capital if they have an eager fan base by selling assets that will automatically return value from their future income. Users can purchase any products they choose from the marketplace, and trade with their peers to earn cryptocurrency. 

## 17.2.		Business Experience:

Business adoption of WeYouMe is vital to the long-term success of the platform. With WeYouMe, we offer businesses the ability to manage all aspects of their business transaction processes using free cryptocurrency payments. These have no chargebacks and are finalized in seconds. 

WeYouMe charges a 2% fee when a mediation team is used to secure the transaction. Businesses that deliver quality products and content can gain large followings and use their posts to reach new customers directly within WeYouMe. Membership options enable businesses to leverage their accounts even further to bring their message and products to the world. 

Advertising delivers exposure to focused groups of WeYouMe users, without requiring invasive data mining. WeYouMe’s social graph is completely public, with all connections visible to applications. Since business advertising creative is formatted equally to other posts, they can be organically discovered and earn content rewards to cover advertising expenditure. Content views are measured directly on the blockchain, meaning that impression counts are cryptographically verifiable, and signed by each account themselves. Content viewers can additionally earn rewards from viewing content out of each post’s content rewards, and from a revenue share from the advertising revenue earned by their interface application.

All public user data is visible on the blockchain, enabling a wide range of research to be conducted to ensure that our campaigns have an impact. Business accounts can connect with users, just as profile accounts do. These connections enable further information to be directly visible for market research, with the user’s permission and authorization. WeYouMe advertising expenditures return value to our users, infrastructure providers, and stakeholders. When businesses benefit at WeYouMe, everybody benefits. 

## 17.3.		Development:

The initial development team at WeYouMe will be assembled from the best that the graphene and blockchain community has to offer. Once the network is live, developers will be able to join the project as open source volunteers, and as members of the development pool. The members with the highest voting support for their contributions will receive ongoing rewards. This will crowdsource development talent from around the world to work on the WeYouMe codebase. Developers will communicate transparently about the improvements, bugfixes, and changes that they have made. Developers in the pool are incentivized to earn and maintain community votes to increase their ongoing reward payments. 

The WeYouMe network will operate on a six-monthly cycle of continuous deployment, with planned hard fork upgrades to provide a consistently improving and stable network. All code released and used by the WeYouMe network will always be open source. Open source code is able to be audited, modified, and improved by anyone around the world. 

Radical transparency enabled the cryptocurrency movement to exist, and WeYouMe will continue to build on that ideal. WeYouMe will be completely open to permissionless innovation, and will welcome alternative client implementations, and interfaces for browsing the blockchain.  

## 17.4.		Community:

WeYouMe will foster a close sense of community on the network, by helping everybody to help each other. WeYouMe will be a fun environment, where people can share and be rewarded for anything that their peers find valuable. Voting power is offered proportionally to stake weight, meaning that those with the greatest commitment to WeYouMe are able to impact it more meaningfully. Value is earned by everyone in the ecosystem for participating, and that value increases when the network grows and develops. 

The connection is the bedrock of our community. Users can connect with friends in ways never done before. Connections are a direct and cryptographic partnership between users. WeYouMe will be the first social media network that enables users to own their own private information, and directly control who has access to it through encryption. 

Users will have a direct payment system with all of the people and businesses that are important to them, enabling financial collaboration, and cooperation. When users combine voting power with friends and companions, they commit value to that connection, and share it freely with each other.

## 17.5.		Marketing:

WeYouMe’s marketing will strive to be welcoming, impactful, open, sophisticated, and elegant. We will take a positive stance on global issues of freedom of speech, economic freedom, organizational transparency, and digital privacy. WeYouMe will build on the growing movement of radical transparency, radical honesty and radical openness to new ideas. 

We recognize that everyone that joins WeYouMe does so for their own unique reasons. Our marketing strategy will help everybody to realize their reason to be a part of our network.

WeYouMe’s content and activity reward design will earn everybody a small daily income, and a larger income for posting content. For low income users, this may be a significant financial assistance. WeYouMe will highlight the financial freedom offered to the members of the community most in need.

WeYouMe’s marketing officers will be elected, and will be tasked with producing multimedia content and running advertising campaigns. These 50 people or groups will earn MeCoin for their work, driving the best marketing leaders to rise to the top. There may be a multitude of WeYouMe brand images, each with their own quirks and differences. 

WeYouMe is not carved in stone. It is a living community, it is a shared idea. It will evolve over time, and adapt to the changing ideas of the marketing team members. Everyone can bring a piece of themselves to the table when they portray the WeYouMe message to the world.

Every community on Earth has its own cultures and customs. WeYouMe will transcend them all by allowing our message of freedom, transparency, and community to resonate in every corner of Earth, in every language. 

## 17.6.		Investment Appreciation: 

Investors are a high priority for the WeYouMe network. Without their support, WeYouMe cannot grow to reach its potential. The WYM asset delivers 20% of all MeCoin issuance to its holders. This corresponds to 20% of the revenue of the WeYouMe network. Growth in the value of the WYM and MeCoin assets occurs with growth in the network effect value offered by those assets, given that they are both scarce, and useful. MeCoin is consistently burned by network revenue to counteract the asset’s inflation rate, and provides a closed loop ecosystem for monetary flow from advertisers, membership subscribers and service users to network contributors and investors. 

## 17.7.		Governance:

WeYouMe is the first Decentralized Autonomous Corporation that will have annual Executive elections. The board of WeYouMe Executives will predominantly serve as points of coordination, oversee the generation and redemption of MeCredit to finance the WeYouMe labor force, and deliver valuable results. They will engage the community and facilitate dialogue and cooperation between the Developers, Witnesses, Miners, Investors, Marketers, Advocates, and Users. 

They will have a limited capacity to influence the network, acting mainly to oversee issuance and distribution of MeCredit for salaries, and individual projects. Their budget is subject to network approval, and they only earn a salary when the value of MeCredit is normalized and stable. MeCredit is used to hire and manage teams of full time employees, wherever they are based. They will be free to start Businesses on WeYouMe and with their local jurisdiction to produce value for the WeYouMe community. Network elections will be used to conduct on-chain voting proposals for the selection of Executive board members, and for approvals of MeCredit issuance. All issuance of MeCredit against the network revenue, and all funds that flow through the “weyoume” main account will be transparent.

## 17.8.		Advocacy:

Advocacy in favour of cryptocurrencies is the next step towards improving the relationship between government entities and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. WeYouMe will finance representatives to engage in advocacy work according to user votes. These advocates will help shape the legal landscape that the cryptocurrency ecosystem operates under. They will materially assist and consult with any WeYouMe business that faces unwarranted legal pressure or litigation.

While WeYouMe is a decentralized autonomous corporation, there is still a need for regulated businesses to act within the fiat monetary system as intermediaries. Favorable regulation, strong business relationships, and support from community organizations will be the primary goal of WeYouMe’s advocacy board. Not only will they advocate for WeYouMe, but for the entire cryptocurrency space a whole. The network will be committed to achieving recognition of cryptocurrencies as global digital currencies that are independent from the fiat monetary system.

## 17.9.		Infrastructure:

The backbone of WeYouMe is the distributed infrastructure that operates the network. By rewarding those that provide WeYouMe with encrypted storage space, processing power, and bandwidth, WeYouMe becomes a more valuable network on which to build. Supernode and Witness rewards benefit those that are able to host the most effective witness nodes and Supernodes, at the lowest operating costs. By utilizing the globe’s idle infrastructure, WeYouMe achieves low infrastructure costs. The rewards offered by operating a Supernode compensate for the costs of operating a node. This lowers the barrier to entry for node ownership, and improves network decentralization by maintaining a low net node operating cost.

The Supernode network will improve the decentralization of the WeYouMe network. By using IPFS (Interplanetary File System), WeYouMe will make the content of its network encrypted, sharded, and permanent. 
All files and transactions on the blockchain and on IPFS will be stored all around the world on the computers of its users. This will place content distribution points very close to individual users, providing a low latency peer to peer file retrieval system. The WeYouMe Desktop Full Node will allow any user to run and connect a local IPFS node, and earn income by providing content seeding to the network. 

By having the network architecture operated and owned by users, WeYouMe will distribute MeCoin fairly to users based on content delivery. By incentivizing the operation of full nodes for processing transactions, and recording the blockchain, the transaction history of the network can be verified by a wide range of users and businesses. 

This architecture maximizes the difficulty and cost of compromising the censorship resistance of the WeYouMe network, as all uploaded content is held by many independent servers with no central point of failure. Additionally, all users may host their own mirrors of the WeYouMe web interface as the website will be open source, and will enable connection to any public or local WeYouMe Full Node API.

# 18.		Revenue Sources:

WeYouMe will be one of few blockchain networks that directly earns revenue from its users, in order to deliver returns to its holders beyond speculative flows. WeYouMe will utilize several key sources of revenue to earn its network participants and asset holders a return on their investment. All fees are minimal to ensure a low cost, high volume approach to revenue that encourages ecosystem growth. 

Network revenue is distributed between the MeCoin and MeCredit burn system, the account registrar, the account referrer, and the creators of premium partner content. The remaining value is network revenue that increases the value of MeCoin. Fees are paid to the network through the purchase and burning of MeCoin by sending it to an inaccessible address, reducing its supply. This gives newly issued MeCoin a higher price, effectively transferring value to everyone that receives rewards from the network.

## 18.1.		Advertising:

Advertising expenditure on social media is a multi-billion-dollar market. In 2016, the combined advertising revenue of the largest advertising platforms on social media networks including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, totals to over $30 Billion. This revenue undergoes typical growth of over 25% per year. 

WeYouMe’s Advertising can help build new and growing creators, by enhancing their exposure to new viewers, and customers. Advertisers can receive valuable engagement from display inventory embedded within feeds, boards, post recommendations, search results, and tags. Campaigns can be targeted to specific areas and audiences within the network, using publicly visible blockchain data. All post views, and transaction responses are verifiable and measurable on the WeYouMe blockchain. Advertisers bid to purchase inventory from application interfaces and distribute value to users and the network over time.

WeYouMe aims to capture 5% of the global social media advertising expenditure market share within five years of Public 2.0 release. Cryptocurrency users are the first market segment that WeYouMe will focus on, before reaching out to sporting organizations, and content creators with large audiences, such as video and audio producers. WeYouMe will aim to offer a better monetization experience for their content, and will allow them to leverage their income to raise capital to expand their production enterprise.

## 18.2.		Premium Content Fees:

High quality content is the key to the user retention and expansion of WeYouMe. Platforms like the iTunes Store, iOS App Store, Google Play store, and Yours.org demonstrate the demand for individually purchased applications, movies, songs, and blog posts. With cryptocurrency solutions to the problems posed by microtransactions, WeYouMe is positioned to discover the full potential of the user generated premium content market. 

By enabling creators to charge any desired price for access to their videos, images, songs, files, or applications, creators can earn directly from user purchases without intermediaries. With free transactions, any price is possible for content, even amounts below 1 cent can be charged and accepted, directly from the user’s MeCoin or MeUSD balances. The markets for high quality mobile applications, music, and feature length films will be key leaders in the premium content revenue stream. By charging a nominal price of 5 cents to download a song, or 20 cents to download a movie, content producers can remove expensive middlemen and earn almost all of the sales revenue for their media releases. 

For this ability to sell digital content to the network, WeYouMe charges a 2% fee on the sale price of premium content. Peer to peer file sharing will be incredibly valuable to producers, as the fastest and cheapest content distribution mechanism can become directly profitable. Valuable software and media can be distributed securely and rapidly.

WeYouMe aims to capture a 5% market share of all digital media sales within five years of Public 2.0 release. By focusing on frictionless purchases, decryption, and downloading of premium content, files can be served directly in return for MeCoin payment. Unique content only available on WeYouMe will drive inflows of fiat currency onto the WeYouMe network, and fuel strong market demand for MeCoin as a medium of exchange. Digital software producers and media creators can upload their work to WeYouMe to access global peer to peer content distribution, retain 98% of their revenue, and earn content rewards according to user voting. 

## 18.3.		Account Memberships:

Subscription services deliver content to users with an ad-free premium experience. Subscription revenue to popular content streaming platforms, such as Netflix, YouTube Red, Apple Music, Spotify Premium, and Patreon totals in the billions of dollars. Netflix earned over $11 Billion in revenue in 2017. Viewers of premium content are typically prepared to pay between $10 and $20 a month to access large volumes of high end on-demand entertainment. WeYouMe asserts that mainstream users would be prepared to pay a monthly Standard or Mezzanine membership to access the content made by WeYouMe Premium partners for free, rather than purchase them individually. 

A standard membership enables advertising to be disabled, and presents a low barrier to entry for premium users at $2.50 per month. Content creators with a Mezzanine Membership are eligible for their posts to be featured, presenting an opportunity to reach a large audience. Large popular creators and network officers gain bonuses to content rewards and voting power with a Top Level Membership, and receive increased voting power in all network officer pools. 

WeYouMe aims to capture 5% of the global market share for subscription based premium content delivery within five years of Public 2.0 release. By enabling creators to retain all of the subscription payments and tips paid to them, while only having a 2% fee on premium content sales, WeYouMe will offer a platform for the world’s best content creators to earn from their work. Holders of WeYouMe memberships will have access to a large allocation of premium content for free, and returns all the majority of membership revenue to Premium partners, and to network contributors.

## 18.4.		Decentralized Exchange Trading Fees:

Cryptocurrency exchanges earn millions of dollars from trading and listing fees by enabling users to trade their digital assets from one form to another. By facilitating deposits and withdrawals and running a trading orderbook, exchanges earn on the order of between 0.1% and 1% of exchange volume. Popular Exchanges, such as Binance, GDax, and Bitfinex regularly exceed $1 billion in daily volume. 

The Bitshares decentralized exchange enables trading to be conducted on its blockchain, and offers lower fees than centralized counterparts. Bitshares has small platform fees, and optional asset fees returned to asset creators. Trading on decentralized exchanges enables many gateway asset providers to operate on the same orderbook. All assets can be traded for all other assets in trading pairs. By enabling accounts to create free user issued assets, a multitude of new assets can be created by users without requiring the knowledge of any programming language. These assets can be used for raising capital for any content creation, research, or business formation. Revenue streams can be distributed to holders automatically, allowing all businesses to have a secure publicly traded equity instrument. 

WeYouMe aims to achieve an average daily trading volume of over $500,000,000 USD within five years of Public 2.0 release. WeYouMe will promote the use of its decentralized exchange by charging zero trading fees on maker orders. This will drive liquidity on the orderbook, and allow market makers to high earn profits from arbitrage to ensure low price spreads. By utilizing an integrated Bancor Asset array, the WeYouMe decentralized exchange will offer additional asynchronous and autonomous liquidity on popular assets, using Liquidity Arrays.

## 18.5.		Peer to Peer Lending Interest fees:

Cryptocurrency exchanges often feature margin trading capabilities, which enable users to borrow funds from other users at interest, and use them to make leveraged trades. Exchanges such as Bitfinex, Poloniex, and Kraken support margin trading orders, and allow lenders to earn interest. Bitfinex generally has over $1 Billion in active margin funding at any given time, and charges lenders a fee of 15% of earned interest. These exchanges increase their trading volume significantly with margin trading of idle funds. Peer to peer lending platforms, such as Bitbond, and EthLend enable members to lend funds between each other. 

WeYouMe users will be free to lend capital to whomever they choose to accept. By supporting the flow of credit within the WeYouMe ecosystem, the platform will charge a fee of 5% of interest paid from the taker side of the peer to peer lending order. Lending orders for margin trading will be supported by forced liquidation if the position becomes undercollateralized. Orders for peer to peer lending can be supported by collateral, and will typically have variable interest rates, terms, and credit reputation requirements according to lender due diligence.

WeYouMe aims to achieve a 5% market share of all outstanding cryptocurrency based loans within five years of Public 2.0 release. By having low fees, and enabling users to make their own credit decisions, the network will utilize the maximum amount of working capital to finance the creative and productive endeavors of its entrepreneurial users. Users are advised to diversify their loan portfolio, and charge adequate interest to compensate for possible defaults. Business opportunities will exist for WeYouMe credit brokers to borrow funds at low interest rates by establishing a strong reputation, and lend them to a wide variety of suitable creditworthy users at a higher rate of interest.

## 18.6.		Marketplace Mediation Fees:

Digital marketplaces have revolutionized commerce by allowing products to be sold without requiring a physical shopfront, and across international borders. Platforms like Ebay, and Amazon enable online retailers to offer products to a wide global customer base. In 2017, Ebay earned over $6.4 Billion in marketplace sales revenue, by charging sales fees on the order of 11% of the sale value, membership fees for stores, and insertion fees for higher value items. 

WeYouMe brings the fees for standard marketplace sales down to 2%, by using a public mediation system to manage sales with integrated multisignature escrow. Mediation services are optional, and if no mediators are used, no marketplace fee is charged. Mediation fees distributed between mediators, network revenue, and interface applications. Dispute resolution is carried out by teams of appointed and random mediators, with financial incentives to award funds to the legitimate party in each transaction in cases of fraud. 

WeYouMe aims to achieve a 5% market share of cryptocurrency based digital commerce sales within five years of Public 2.0 release. WeYouMe will leverage its free transactions to encourage organic growth in the development of new start-up businesses to sell products on WeYouMe. Existing businesses will be able to switch to WeYouMe to save large sums on sales and listing fees instantly, while having an integrated communications platform to market their products to a wide audience. 

WeYouMe marketplace trades will have the ability to be pseudonymous, providing privacy to buyers and sellers, while enabling reputations to be built and upheld. Product ratings will be backed by stake weighting, and on chain verifiable sales. Therefore, users can expect a lower incidence of false and automated reviews on products, and are rewarded for providing valuable information to incoming purchasers. Businesses will have immutable cryptographic proof of product promotion impressions, with public blockchain view transactions. 

# 19.		Expense Outlines:

WeYouMe’s costs will be primarily comprised of development expenses, operational expenses, marketing expenses, and legal costs. All WeYouMe financial flows until the launch of the mainnet blockchain will occur through the Bitshares account “weyoume”. This Bitshares account will be secured by a threshold multi-signature system between the eight founding members of the WeYouMe Executive board. 

## 19.1.		Development costs:

WeYouMe will allocate 35% of funds raised to development expenses. Funds will be used to hire advanced development professionals, and distribute bounties to open source contributors. The WeYouMe executive board will have two initial lead developers. The Chief Development Officer will be responsible for managing the open source development team, hiring additional developers, and producing code necessary to build the network software. The Chief Technology officer will also produce the code necessary to build the network software, and will focus more directly on maintaining the uptime and security of the WeYouMe infrastructure. WeYouMe will iterate on a monthly cycle for small changes, and will complete planned network upgrades every 6 months on predetermined dates each year. Specifications for network upgrades will be frozen 3 months in advance for implementation by all third parties and rigorous high assurance testing.

## 19.2.		Operational costs:

WeYouMe will allocate 25% of funds raised to operational expenses. Funds will be used to access teamworking space, hosting costs, and advisement on specialized technical aspects of the project. The WeYouMe executive board will have two initial operational professionals, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Operating Officer. The Chief Executive Officer will be responsible for the overall coordination of the executive board, and guide the direction of the project. The Chief Operating officer will work at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer to manage communications, and ensure uptime of the WeYouMe network infrastructure. Initially, WeYouMe will operate a network of Supernodes hosted on global content distribution networks and physical servers. Over time, new users will be able to join the Supernode network to power the blockchain and file storage systems. 

## 19.3.		Marketing costs:

WeYouMe will allocate 25% of funds raised to marketing expenses. Funds will be used to hire marketing professionals, and promote the WeYouMe applications on social media platforms. The WeYouMe Executive board will have two initial marketing professionals, the Chief Marketing Officer, and the Chief Design Officer. The Chief Marketing Officer will be responsible for coordinating marketing campaigns across all platforms, running each campaign and engaging with the community to develop grass roots support for the network among users, and businesses. The Chief Design Officer will focus on developing and improving the Brand Image of WeYouMe for use in marketing campaigns, as well as optimising the User Interfaces on all platforms for simplicity, clarity, and usability by a mainstream audience. WeYouMe will be intuitive, and elegant, with the complex features, options, and settings available explained by a wide base of engaging documentation and tutorial content.

## 19.4.		Legal Costs:

WeYouMe will allocate 10% of funds raised to legal expenses. Funds will be used to hire expert legal consultation, and support any necessary regulatory measures. The WeYouMe Executive Board will have a legal professional, the Chief Advocacy Officer. The Chief Advocacy Officer will conduct legal proceedings and duties on behalf of the Executive Board. They will be responsible for managing any necessary regulatory compliance of the WeYouMe Executive Board. WeYouMe, however, will not be directly engaging with the Fiat monetary system, or registering any formal organization within any government jurisdiction. All efforts will be made to absolutely minimise any impact of regulatory action taken on the WeYouMe Network. They will co-ordinate the Advocacy Officers and work to create a legal framework to ensure the long-term viability and growth of both the WeYouMe network, and the Cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. 

## 19.5.	 	Other Costs:

WeYouMe will allocate 5% of funds raised to other expenses. These expenses include a reserve to support cost overruns, small immaterial expenses, hardware purchases for initial infrastructure, and other unforeseen events. Expenses will be overseen by the Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer will manage the funds of the Executive board, and will produce accounting documentation. They will determine individual project budgeting, and ensure the maximum utility of all funds raised by the WeYouMe network. 

# 20.		Funding Strategies:

WeYouMe will undergo a multi-stage process to obtain the funding necessary to meet development costs. Contact team@weyoume.io to enquire.

## 20.1.		Pre-Seed round:

25% of the equity of WeYouMe Pty. Ltd. and 500,000 WYM will be allocated to Private investors. This offering will be allocated at a company valuation of $2,000,000. Minimum investment of $50,000 USD, and a maximum contribution of $500,000 per investor. Contributions of more than $250,000 will be offered a 10% bonus.

## 20.2.		Seed round:

1,000,000 WYM will be allocated to Private investors. This sale will be at a rate of $2.00 USD per WYM, with a minimum investment of $50,000 USD, and a maximum contribution of $500,000 per investor. Contributions of more than $250,000 will be offered a 10% bonus.

## 20.3.		Initial Coin Offering:

WeYouMe will raise a larger funding from the Initial Coin Offering. 5,000,000 units of WYM will be sold over regular daily intervals. Bids will be placed in any of the ten supported cryptocurrencies to purchase WYM, for 200 23-hour periods of 25,000 WYM each. Each contributor will receive a proportional allocation of WYM to their nominated Bitshares address.

Proceeds from this offering will be used to deliver the Public Beta Release of WeYouMe. The Alpha Mainnet release will launch the mainnet blockchain, with working content Rewards, Supernode network, private messaging and posting, and network officer reward pools. The Public 1.0 will launch the creation of business accounts with linked cryptoassets, anonymous posting, WeYouMe backed cryptocurrency gateway assets, and the introduction of revenue features including membership assets, premium content, marketplace trading, post promotion. The web interface WeYouMe.io will be open to the public, and content management systems will be enabled for filtering and delisting content from boards by elected moderator consensus. 

## 20.4.		Executive Board reserve income:

The WeYouMe Executive Account will hold a reserve of 250,000 WYM, which will earn MeCoin rewards. This reward income will be used to finance a minimum viable level of Executive board operations in perpetuity. This income will be used at the discretion of the elected Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer. This reserve principal cannot be spent, only the returns earned on it. These funds can be lent on the peer to peer exchange to earn additional interest for Executive board discretionary income. 

## 20.5.		MeCredit Issuance:

MeCredit is the cryptocredit of the WeYouMe Network, and can be issued in a limited supply according to price. It will enable the Executive board to borrow funds from future network revenue to finance operations, development, and other expenses. It will be used to pay the publicly elected members of the WeYouMe Executive board an annual salary for work completed. All issuances of MeCredit must be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and at least 51% of the WeYouMe network voting power. Issuances are publicly accountable, and can only source value from network revenue. No inflation of any WeYouMe network cryptoassets such as MeCoin, or MeUSD is possible. This will provide the majority of Executive board funding in perpetuity, with publicly supported annual budgets of MeCredit to be sold at market prices to willing and voluntary creditors, which receive a competitive variable interest rate. If WeYouMe Executive board members issue excessive amounts of MeCredit, a fall in price below face value will automatically prevent additional issuance until the price recovers. 

# 21.		Entry Strategy:

The market entry strategy of WeYouMe will be a critically important part of how the network is launched. The early users of the blockchain will have a long-term impact on the culture of the community over the course of the future. Therefore, it is important that we focus the resources of the project in acquiring and retaining the right users, at the right time, and in the right order to gain maximum benefit and growth.

Early Community development and growth initiatives will focus on a dense local adoption in Australia, focusing on Sporting Organizations, players, fans, University students, and social media influencers. 

University students are most likely to be interested in social media, as it forms an integral part of their communication and forms a strong long-term customer base. Young adults have the most to benefit from earning additional supplementary income, and are likely to be most receptive to monetary innovation. 

## 21.1.		Mainnet Alpha:

Adoption focus: Microblogging first. Australian University Students focusing on clubs and societies members. Cryptocurrency users, blockchain community leaders, free speech proponents, and influencers. 

User sources: Twitter, Steemit, Minds, Telegram, cryptocurrency meetups, Facebook University group pages.

User Sources: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Ethereum community. 

Key Problems Solved: The ability to sell products directly to followers on the WeYouMe Marketplace. The ability to raise capital from WeYouMe users directly using the Decentralized Exchange.  

# 22.		Growth Strategy:

Initial network growth will be directed by the incentive structures that are in place within the WeYouMe protocol, platform marketing and applications. Viral growth in user adoption will be shaped by the rate of exposure to new users, and by the retention of existing users. This forms an r/K optimization strategy that WeYouMe will activate to drive awareness, acquire new users, activate users, drive peer to peer engagement, retain users, and promote referral activity. Network infrastructure is based on emerging decentralized technologies, allowing it to scale with the addition of new users. Users are incentivized to host network files, refer new users, and consistently post high quality content to earn income. 

WeYouMe will implement a 5-stage process to create a positive growth cycle:

1.	User Acquisition: Acquire the most users possible at the lowest cost possible, with a brand strategy that provides as much engagement as possible. 
2.	User Activation: Activate incoming users to WeYouMe, by having the highest rate of successful account creation possible, and lowest time to creating their first post possible. 
3.	User Engagement: Engage the userbase of WeYouMe to create as much valuable content as possible, while delivering the highest amount of value back to the user as possible, with the highest degree of product market fit as possible.
4.	User Retention: Retain existing users by continuing to deliver customer value for as long as possible, with the lowest user churn rate possible, and the highest expected customer lifetime value possible. 
5.	User Referral: As a result of Engagement and retention, empower users to grow the network by introducing as many of their existing connections as possible, while ensuring a positive experience for newly referred users.  

## 22.1.		User Acquisition:

### Content Sharing: 

When users share content to other networks, they direct traffic to the WeYouMe platform and encourage signups. This forms the backbone of the long-term acquisition loop of the platform, as each user that sees shared content from outside of the network is able to discover the platform. When users share content to other networks and lead the user to signup, the referral is recorded on the blockchain and earns them rewards.

### Sharedrop:

At the mainnet launch of the blockchain, all holders of a variety of cryptocurrencies will have a sharedrop distribution that they can claim when they sign up. This acts to bootstrap the WYM asset on the base of existing cryptocurrency holders. It is an initial driver of curiosity and can lead to news coverage in the wider cryptocurrency community. 

Users will receive a sharedropped balance of WYM proportional to their holdings. Using their account, they will be able to participate in the network by posting and voting on content. Alternatively, users can sell their WYM balances on the Decentralized exchange or external exchanges, and receive a reward on their regular cryptocurrency holdings. WeYouMe believes that once a cryptocurrency holder has made an account and experienced what the network has to offer, they will be more than likely to continue using the platform and hold onto their WYM.

The sharedrop will accomplish many important goals. It will give a broad base of cryptocurrency users a direct reason to learn about WeYouMe, visit the WeYouMe website, and create an account. This sharedrop will be the largest reaching initial distribution of a cryptocurrency done before, to allow as many people as possible to experience WeYouMe, and join the community with a financial stake in its success.

### Featured content:

The Featured content selection list is a feed of the highest quality recent content from members on the network, as voted by users. It is updated once per hour, and is ideal for a wide distribution to broadcasters and news wire services. This acts to focus attention on the best content created on the platform, and circulate it widely. 

## 22.2.		User Activation:

### Onboarding Sequence:

The web and mobile onboarding experience enables users to import their phone or email contact list to attempt to find existing friends.
If users opt to connect with weyoume.io using the APIs of other networks, they can add their existing friends from Facebook, and follow their existing network on Twitter. It prompts new users to select a set of their interests, and automatically populates their home feed by subscribing to boards that are relevant to those interests, and subscribing to members that are relevant to those interests. This provides an immediately rich experience of content. The initial sorting algorithm will be set to a high latency for new users, so that they first see the best content from the blockchain archive before moving to more recent content flows from their user and board network. 

### Content Rewards: 

WeYouMe content rewards allow users to earn directly from their content, as curated by users. This drives a significant boost to activation rates, as new users see the potential for earnings, and are likely to contribute content more readily and more frequently. MeCoin provides the collaborative link between the ecosystem participants for value exchange, and market based curation. This incentive structure allows social content value to flow directly between ecosystem participants, without an intermediary acting as gatekeeper for distribution of network revenue.

WeYouMe will offer social media users around the world something that established platforms do not, and for the most part, cannot. The network will directly share income for content based on user voting and views. 25% of newly issued MeCoin will be distributed to every content creator, according to the stake weighted votes and views that their creations earn. This reward will return a significant portion of the value of the platform to where it belongs, in the wallets of users. 

The value to back this income will be sourced from sustainable, and user-friendly means. Advertising will allow ordinary users and businesses an ability to engage with new users and customers. Advertising will be clearly denominated, and formatted identically to other posts. They will also be organically visible as regular posts when sorted. Account memberships will allow users to disable advertising, and access many advantages for supporting the platform. 

## 22.3.		User Engagement:

### Groups: 

Users are able to create groups to add their friends and network members. This facilitates the growth of the network at an individual level, as each group is self-interested to grow by adding new members, and posting high quality content to attract new members. Moderators earn a portion from the content rewards of all of the posts that are made to their group. The ability for the creation of public, private and exclusive groups facilitates a variety of social structures and offers increasing levels of privacy, such that users are free to speak openly within their community.

### Boards: 

Users are able to create boards to facilitate discussion around a particular topic, open to public posting and viewing. Boards will compete to add new subscribers, to gain more content rewards for the posts within it. Moderators can earn a portion of the content rewards from posts made in their boards, offering them an incentive to grow their outreach, introduce new users, and post great content to draw in new subscribers. 

### Comment Payments:

Users with significant influence are able to create content that has a comment micropayment price. This drives higher engagement, as creators are incentivized to produce content that encourages commenting, and are more likely to reply to increase commenting activity. When users make a small payment to create a comment, they are more invested in the conversation, and because of this small payment, low quality comments are less likely to occur, allowing authors to focus on replying to high value comments.

## 22.4.	 	User Retention:

### Connections: 

A large base of connections can be established by users to follow along with content, and when users upgrade their connections into friends, they receive a notification each time they post. Users generate connection transactions to send decryption keys for sharing private posts. This leads to personally relevant content from people that the user is individually familiar with. 

Consecutive days with a message or picture sent between connections have a counter that increments every day and changes icons to follow milestones. This encourages users to maintain contact with their connections and validates the strength and duration of their connection.

When users increase their connection strength to friends and companions, they vest an additional amount of MeCoin in the connection for shared voting, and they increase the ranking of each other’s posts in feeds. This drives investment into the user’s network, and increases the value attached with having such a connection. Users that become companions have access to a shared wallet, for joint payments. 

### Activity Rewards: 

Users are able to earn a small reward for each day that they actively contribute content to the network. 2.5% of MeCoin issuance is divided between all active users each day. Activity Rewards will act as a small Universal Basic Income to be implemented at a global scale. This income will be made available to all profile accounts each day, and is paid regardless of income or social status, without any invasive welfare requirements, or bureaucratic compliance overhead. The Activity reward derives value from network revenue, and is an integral part of the objective of WeYouMe to build social media to serve a positive purpose, by directly giving back to the community. To qualify, users need to make a post that is in the top 50th percentile of voting power. This directly rewards the most active users over time. 

### Lifetime Content Rewards Measure:

When content creators earn content rewards from the blockchain, their account increases its lifetime content rewards measure. This statistic is displayed on profile pages and acts as a reputation measure for accounts. Long term users are able to demonstrate their long term work put into making and releasing great content. This is an unbuyable quantitative measure of an account’s total success, encouraging commitment and investment into their accounts reputation. 

### Open Financial Services:

A simple platform for transactions will enable billions of unbanked and underbanked people around the world to enjoy access to the financial system for the first time in their lives. WeYouMe can be used by anyone, regardless of their age, social status, ethnicity, or gender, which present barriers to financial freedom in many nations.

WeYouMe does not require any identification to create an account, meaning that people from all countries, regardless of political or economic stability, will have access to a payment system, and a global mechanism for wealth storage outside of the fiat monetary system.
Young people will be able to participate in the global economy as there is no age requirement for joining WeYouMe and having access this payment network. 

## 22.5.		User Referral:

### Onboarding Reward: 

When a user introduces a new account to the network, they are able to earn an onboarding reward paid to both the new user, and the referrer equally. This is paid as a two-sided signup bonus for a limited time after the launch of the Alpha Mainnet, to invited participants. A limited number of invites are offered per registered account, and a profile account must be created to claim the bonus. The number of invitations per user are limited to prevent spam, and ensure that concern is taken when deciding which people to invite. This builds a powerful early acquisition loop, as each user that is invited is directed to invite a limited number of new participants to increase their onboarding bonus.

### Account Referrals: 

Referring users and registrar service providers earn an ongoing return from the revenue that the account contributes to the network. This lasts for the lifetime of the user, and is sourced from membership payments, advertising, and other network revenue sources. 

5% of all fees, membership revenue, and promotion payments are distributed to the account’s registrar, and 5% is distributed to the referrer. A registrar service provider pays the account registration fee, and up to 3 times the value of the fee is returned to the registrar out of incoming content rewards and activity rewards from the new account.

This allows users to earn an ongoing income by introducing new users to WeYouMe and encouraging them to make valuable content, promote their posts and purchase memberships. This additionally rewards third party platform operators that introduce new users to the WeYouMe network. 

# 23.		Market Advantages:

The value proposition of the WeYouMe protocol is based upon its ability to form a network effect of social media interaction, trading liquidity, and marketplace sales. 

## 23.1.		Social Network Effect:

The Social network effect of WeYouMe is facilitated by the virality of high quality content for both user retention and user acquisition loops. The WeYouMe team will bootstrap this network by posting high quality content and sharing it across external social networks to attract new users. 

### Content Creators: 

Content creators are able to earn content rewards that are higher than other networks that are based only on advertising royalties. This encourages high value content creators to switch to WeYouMe and release it on the network first. Monetization tools, such as premium content sales, subscription assets, and the ability to raise funds from cryptoasset offerings will offer creators the ability to crowdfund their production budgets, and earn a better return than other networks. 

Content creators are able to bypass traditional intermediaries that stand between them and their monetization revenue, and do not need to be accepted into a partnership network to monetize. This removes layers of bureaucracy and rent seeking from advertising middlemen, and ensures that creators get paid must faster for their work. Value is able to be distributed before advertising revenue flow is established, creating an inflation based bootstrapping effect to incentivize content creators before the membership and promotion inflows are present to kickstart value transfer to content creators. 

### Content Viewers: 

Content viewers benefit from a variety of customizable sorting options to find the best content for them, and from the level of investment into quality content that is made possible by content rewards paid to creators. Viewers also benefit from the freedom offered to content creators to cater directly to their interests, instead of catering to advertiser conventions and limitations on topics. Viewers are able to directly support he creators that they enjoy the most with monthly subscriptions within the platform, instead of needing to create an additional profile on a monetization specific application. 

### Curators:

Content curators benefit from curation rewards that scale with the speed at which they discover content. Users that are the first to find great content and expend charges to like it receive a larger share of the curation rewards for the post. Curators with a reasonable amount of voting power can earn significant rewards for finding great content before other curators, and have a large impact on the shape of the content on the network. Curators play a vital role in the prosperity of WeYouMe. Established graphene social networks have diminished the importance of curators in favour of voting bots. WeYouMe returns to a non-linear content reward scaling algorithm to once again incentivize curators to vote on posts that are likely to gain later upvotes, and have a higher likelihood of greater curation rewards.

### Advertisers: 

WeYouMe’s advertisers will gain advantages over existing platforms, primarily from having secure and decentralized metrics for viewership of their content on the blockchain. A large variety of cost metrics can be used to target advertising campaigns, and drive activity exactly where it is desired for business growth. A massive base of public data is made available for analysis by marketers on WeYouMe for targeting promoted content, and promoters have fine-tuned control over which interfaces are able to claim their promoted content payments. 

Marketers can stipulate that their content only be shown to users of a specified set of trusted governance addresses, allowing finer control over brand image association with undesirable content types than competing advertising networks, without sacrificing platform-wide freedom of expression. Promoters benefit from this also, assured that their business will not be censored from being able to publish promoted content based on their industry. 

Businesses will be able to sell promoted products in a single button click. Users can instantly purchase products on the WeYouMe marketplace and premium content directly with the user’s MeCoin balance inline with the feed they are browsing, massively reducing friction and making the reducing the sales funnel down to a single page, the one the user is already actively browsing. Promoters on WeYouMe also have access to metric that are impossible to target on mainstream social media, such as public cryptocurrency balances, and asset portfolios. Promoters can target by specified products in a user’s wishlist, and when users place a product in their wishlist, other users can instantly buy it for them with MeCoin. 

## 23.2.		Marketplace Network Effect:

The WeYouMe Marketplace network effect is constructed by offering buyers, and sellers benefits over existing platforms,  and attracting high quality and reputable mediators to oversee transaction dispute resolution. The WeYouMe team will bootstrap this network as sellers by drop shipping products from wholesale merchants. Mediation services can be launched by the WeYouMe team, and products can be purchased from early sellers as prizes to offer for competitions. 

### Businesses/Sellers: 

Sellers benefit from being able to promote their products directly to users and followers in their feeds and boards. This allows for instant purchase without leaving the browsing experience, decreasing the opportunity to lose customers along the sales funnel. Products can be directly tagged in posts using the exclamation mark in front of the product id. This allows for users and businesses to easily refer to products inline with their posts, without needing an entire link. 

By offering low fee marketplace mediation, without chargeback potential, WeYouMe can significantly reduce the costs of doing business in eCommerce. Payments are held in provable escrow and are released rapidly as soon as the buyer and mediators confirm that they have received the product. Payments are on chain, and do not require the use of any intermediary payment providers, or personal information. 

Sellers gain the benefits of free transactions, while being able to receive any gateway supported currency by using the decentralized exchange to automatically convert incoming payments. The buyer currency is immediately converted to MeCoin for the purchase, which is held in escrow, and then released and converted into the sellers chosen currency for revenue. Stablecoins such as MeUSD can act as a low volatility option for sellers that are sensitive to cryptocurrency price shifts. 

### Purchasers/ Customers: 

WeYouMe makes buying products just as simple and intuitive as liking a post. Users do not need to sign in to external payment services at the checkout, when they pay directly from their MeCoin balance. Shipping details are automatically saved on the device and transmitted to the seller securely in the escrow transaction. The buyer’s chosen and trusted mediator manages the underlying transaction on the buyer’s behalf, and resolves conflicts if they occur.  

Users are able to earn cryptocurrency that they can immediately spend on products and services. This lowers the barrier to entry for users to start enjoying the rewards they have earned, and removes the need to convert MeCoin into fiat after it is earned, if products can simply be bought instead. Customers that make larger purchases with fiat currency are able to deposit their local currency and convert it directly to MeCoin when they make a purchase using the decentralized exchange and supported gateway assets.  

### Mediators:

After vesting their mediation security bond, users are able to become marketplace mediators and earn from the marketplace trading fees that they facilitate. Any verified account can become a mediator, and significant returns can be earned when the mediator facilitates sufficient transaction volumes. Because the vast majority of transactions do not require dispute resolution, mediators can manage multiple marketplace transactions simultaneously by automatically signing when both the buyer and seller confirm the transaction. They are then alerted when dispute resolution is required, and a choice must be made to resolve the dispute between other mediators. This can act as a valuable passive income stream to reputable ecosystem participants, especially when the mediator is frequently nominated as a representative mediator by buyers and sellers, in which case they earn double the fee revenue. 

## 23.3.		Exchange Network Effect:

Liquidity of the orderbooks will be driven by traders acting as makers and takers between businesses seeking capital, and investors seeking return. The WeYouMe team will offer an initial range of gateway assets for trading, and will actively provide liquidity for these pairs.

### Traders: 

The WeYouMe Decentralized exchange will have zero fees for maker orders, incentivizing market makers to provide liquidity to the orderbooks. Integrated Bancor arrays on all MeCoin and MeUSD trading pairs will allow for further liquidity to be accessed with asynchronous market making pools being added into the orderbook. 

Post promotion and membership inflows from Fiat currency gateway assets act to provide an ongoing non-speculative capital inflow into the WeYouMe asset ecosystem. Marketplace purchases add additional trading liquidity when buyers and sellers utilize the exchange to switch the purchase asset to the received asset using MeCoin as an intermediary. 

### Investors:

Investors benefit from WeYouMe by being able to fund projects using the decentralized exchange to back business accounts that have an on-chain auditable account record, and return a guaranteed portion of incoming revenue to stakeholders. Investors have access to new and upcoming international businesses that create cryptoequities on the DEX, and unlike other tokenization platforms, WeYouMe has built in governance addresses to act as signatories for transactions, and applies voting rights over business account leadership and fund usage. Investors are able to finely tune the degree of risk they accept, by investing in highly customizable assets with liquidity options to facilitate a variety of established capital structures, and comply with any desired regulatory environment. 

### Capital raising businesses and projects:

Businesses are able to raise from a global userbase that is engaged with their content and promote their cryptoasset to users directly in feeds. An audience that is engaged with cryptocurrency directly can be access on WeYouMe, and the rewards that they earn can be used to make investments into capital raising structures directly from the decentralized exchange. Listing assets on WeYouMe is free, and assets cannot be delisted. 

Raising capital with cryptocurrency is made highly practical and viable using WeYouMe’s secured cryptoasset offering structure. This provides investors with voting power over the business account, ownership over its assets, and control over the leadership of the business account. Capital raised is distributed upon the completion of milestones, that are verified by the account’s governance address. Businesses are able to finely tune the characteristics of their assets and automatically return value to their investors to inspire confidence, and to comply with whichever regulatory framework they desire. 

A continuous spectrum of options can be tailored to be a completely decentralized, uncontrollable and open asset, or an ideal and compliant business security with your choice of overseeing body. National regulatory agencies are able to create governance accounts for the direct oversight of assets when selected. This includes controls on ownership and trading to a whitelist, and the ability for the issuer to revoke assets if activated. 

## 23.4.		Single User Mode:

Throughout the history of successful products has been an ability to have users first come for a tool, and then stay for a network. The WeYouMe platform will be able to grow at a faster rate if there are significant utilities or services available that provide value to individual users and can attract ecosystem participants before a critical mass is reached. 

The single user mode of WeYouMe will be intended to bootstrap early participants by offering many valuable services via its founding consortium businesses.

# 24.		Social Media Market Analysis:

There are a variety of other projects and businesses that are making an impact on the industry of decentralized social media. WeYouMe asserts that more competition is better for users, and due to the environment of open source software, the relationships between these networks are a positive sum game, where advancements and user acquisition for one network leads to benefits for the entire ecosystem.

The nascent space of these networks facilitates a lead-on effect, for when users discover one network, they are more able to understand and interact on the others. Additionally, when content is stored on public blockchains, interfaces can aggregate content from other networks permissionless and freely. Content on one blockchain can easily be displayed across other networks.

Networks that are able to produce a user experience that can compete with established social media on simplicity, functionality, and virality lead to benefits for the entire ecosystem, as positive open source changes can be rapidly adopted across all projects. 

## 24.1.		Steem [www.steem.io, www.steemit.com]:

Steem is a decentralized blockchain based blogging protocol that is based on the Delegated proof of stake consensus algorithm. Users interact with the Steem blockchain through the primary interface, Steemit.com, and others to post articles and other content, access their wallets, And curate other content. Steem achieves a massive improvement in infrastructure over other decentralized social media platforms by using Delegated proof of stake to lower block times to 3 seconds, and using stake-based rate limiting to achieve no transaction fee requirement. 

Users have access to username cryptocurrency addresses, and can quickly upvote posts to earn curation rewards. Users can transfer funds quickly to other users and vest STEEM into SteemPower for voting. SteemPower has a 13-week vesting schedule, and can be powered down in regular intervals for transfer. Steem plans to introduce Smart Media tokens, which enable user to create their own cryptocurrencies, and raise funds in Steem. Each SMT will have its own voting power, and distribute content rewards to its community when voting, alongside STEEM.

Users have the ability to delegate their voting power to other users to provide them with voting strength, and access a stablecoin, the SteemDollar, to hold value pegged to the U.S. dollar. Accounts have the ability to deposit funds into a savings balance within their account that places a 3 day time lock on their funds for security purposes. 

The Steem blockchain has an ecosystem of over 400 third party applications and services for interacting with, and an open source login API called Steemconnect to facilitate transaction signing without widely distributing private keys or the user’s password. 

Steemit currency relies on third party storage providers for images and videos, which are embedded into the blockchain using standard links. Interfaces have been made to use IPFS, including on d.tube for images, and d.sound for audio. Busy.org implements an alternative interface to Steemit, and utilizes IPFS for file storage. IPFS presents an ideal solution to content storage, because files can be easily replicated across the node network, and are content addressable. 

Pros:
-	Content rewards from blockchain issuance.
-	Delegated proof of stake consensus algorithm.
-	Free Transactions.
-	3 second block times.
-	Content stored on chain, censorship resistant. 
-	Roadmap to implement Smart media tokens.

Cons:
-	Long Signup waiting times, and requires phone number. 
-	Significant Majority of STEEM supply (85%+) was premined and is held by the Steemit.inc team.
-	High degree of vote buying using bidding bots.
-	Difficult for new users to earn significant rewards.

## 24.2.		Minds [www.minds.com]:

Minds is an open source social media platform that is focussed on freedom of speech and monetization for uploaders. It enables users to upload posts, images, videos and blog posts. It allows users to create groups and applies tags to each post for sorting.

The network is monetized by the Minds token, based on Ethereum as an ERC20 token. Users can like posts freely, and remind them. Each interaction increases the points earned by its uploader, and an issuance of Minds are sent to all content creators once per day, as a proportion of their total credits earned. Comments, wires received, and daily logins, and referrals earn additional credits, that are used to issue rewards. Credits are only counted once per unique person, and each user needs to be verified with a phone number to begin earning and contributing credits to creators, to prevent Sybil attacks. 

Minds uses a hybrid structure, whereby all the platform interactions occur over open source centralized server architecture, and the rewards are paid to the users account off-chain. They can then be withdrawn and paid to other users, or paid off-chain to others using the Wire system. This lowers Ethereum gas costs, and maintains interface speed. 

Wire tokens can be used to boost content, by placing it in a sidebar for advertising, or can be sent as tips, or recurring Wire payments to subscribe to premium content. Each Wire offers users a boost of 1000 views per units used for boosting, which is paid to the development team. 

Users have the additional option of becoming monthly subscribers to the platform, which removes boosted content, and grants access to verification badges, and exclusive content. 

Video hosting is enabled on the network by using webtorrent sharing between active peers to increase download speed, while maintaining decentralization and lowering hosting costs. 

Pros:
-	Rewards users for content engagement and quality.
-	Premium content subscription tiers for creators.
-	Onchain and offchain Tips.
-	Post promotion and membership revenue.
-	Referral rewards.
-	Webtorrent video hosting.
-	Boosting payment transactions transparent on Ethereum blockchain.

Ono is a blockchain based social media platform that focusses on messaging and content sharing between users. Leveraging the framework of the EOS blockchain, the network facilitates a fast transaction experience, and allows users to access free transactions for end users. ONO values equality highly, and utilises a reputation system to encourage the creation of high quality content. Content that is downvoted is collapsed, and the network uses a group of Elected Superpartners to  moderate and manage the content of the network. 

The network issues 5 Billion ONOT (ONO Token) each year, which is divided between network contributors, block producers, and content creators, based on the Proof of Contribution algorithm. The distribution algorithm takes into consideration the comments, views and likes of a post, and rewards it with a proportion of ONOT. 

ONOT can be powered up into ONOPower, where it is vested for 13 weeks to offer an interest rate and voting power over reward distribution. ONOT is destroyed to pay for network advertising after 5 years, and the network earns a return from payments made through its in built marketplace. 

ONOPower is used to weight the value of voting and user interactions for reward distribution. Users are additionally rewarded when they login to the network each day, proportionally to the amount of users that log in during that day. 

ONO invites the first 300,000 users to become tone partners for the platform, and rewards them with ONOT for joining early. The userbase is initially focussed in China, and launched internationally after the ICO. 

In the mobile app, users are able to add friends with QR codes, quickly follow relevant users on signup, and create short posts with images included. To write longform content, the user needs to complete a verification process.

The network is based on the STEEM blockchain, and incorporates a variety of sporting specific improvements, including built in peer to peer betting with no house edge, fantasy sports gameplay, and partnerships with sporting media providers. The Web interface lists posts in order of their respective tags to sort them by sport topic, such as soccer, nhl, and nfl. 

The platform aims to include sporting statistical widgets for use in content, and a library of relevant photographs for publishers to include. The Scorum team earns additional income from the use of its photography library, and rewards the uploaders sports images for use across the network.

The network makes economic improvements over Steem by including internal advertising paid for by Scorum Coin, SCR. Like Steem, the coin is powered up to access voting power for content rewards, and is powered down over a 12 month period. The network also includes an activity reward pool for rewarding users each day that have a voting power balance less than 100%. SCR has a fixed supply, and users earn content rewards equal to 40% of the networks advertising revenue on an ongoing basis instead of issuing new SCR from inflation. 

Pros:
-	SCR Limited supply.
-	Content reward issuance to active accounts.
-	Multi-depth comment rewards.
-	Integrated peer to peer Betting exchange.
-	Integrated Fantasy Sports.
-	Advertising revenue split model pays rewards instead of inflation.
-	Partnership potential to offer sports merchandise and event tickets. 

Cons:

## 24.6.		WhaleShares [www.whaleshares.io]:

WhaleShares is a graphene based social media blockchain focussed on the Bitshares community, and is derived from the Steem blockchain with some important changes. 

Users post content in an article format, and curate it by upvoting and sharing at the same time. Users earn WLS for their content in the form of Whalestake, which is powered up and offers voting power. The Blockchain issues WLS content rewards based on votes received by the user, which are weighted by the stake of the curating account. 

All rewards are powered up, and no voting power delegation is possible. Content rewards are distributed after 14 days have elapsed, instead of the 7 day timeframe used by Steem. Votes also consume a larger cost, based on the users mana. Each vote drains 2% of a users mana, allowing for a total of 10 votes per day, as it recharges at a rate of 20% per day. 

Whaleshares is designed to operate as a MASDAC, or Mutual Aid Society Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative. This details how voting members are able to allocate inflation to desired causes, and objectives as desired by the community. 

Whaleshares aims to pioneer the concept of a “Whale token”, a digital asset that is backed by the voting power of a large stakeholder in a MASDAC chain. A Whale Token facilitates the autonomous voting of a post made by a member of the community, by requesting a vote from its issuer. The issuance of these Whale Tokens allow for the effective transfer of larger amounts of voting power than an individual upvote on a post, and at a later time period, spread across a variety of posts of the uploaders choosing.

Whale tokens may then be exchanged between users for a market rate, effectively enabling a large stakeholder to issue the proceeds of their long term voting power in a liquid asset to reward specific individuals or to sell them. 

Whaleshare’s native asset is WLS, and did not have an initial fundraising period or ICO. 70% of the WLS asset was distributed in the form of powered up Whalestake to all Bitshares holders, 10% to WHALESHARE token holders, and 10% to holders of BROWNIE.PTS, an early asset distributed to Bitshares contributors. 

Pros:
-	Content rewards, with a focus on longer term reward distribution and staking.
-	Combination of sharing and voting into single action.
-	Fair and wide distribution to Bitshares holders.
-	No voting power delegation, mitigating voting bots. 

Cons: 
-	14 day reward payout schedule.

SoMee is a social media platform based on the hybrid ONG token, issued on both the Ethereum and Waves blockchains. The protocol uses the gravity formula to weight the value of uploaded content. The algorithm measures the G-Force of a piece of content, as it attracts larger engagement over a short time period. The network integrates with LinkedIn to weigh users with a greater Gravity score when they are more recognised. Gravity specialists are elected to validate and curate content, by fact checking it, and voting accordingly. The algorithm takes into consideration the ratio of upvotes and downvotes, the voting ratio of the comments, and the views into consideration. 

The platform aims to mitigate censorship, and reward user content contributions using onG coin, according to the gravity that each post holds. 150 Million ONGcoins are distributed over the course of 20 years to content creators, on a linear schedule. 

The interface enables users to connect other users as friends, and create groups for sharing content. G-Fuel, and G-Bucks allow users to send and receive payments, and acts as the voting stake for the platform in addition to onG coins.

## 24.11.	Akasha [akasha.world]:

Akasha is an Ethereum based social platform that utilizes the Rinkby Testnet to enable users to share content to their followers. It displays a series of columns that users can customize and reorder. The web application displays either the most recent posts, following list, or posts from a specific user or tag. 

By using Metamask, users can directly transact with the Ethereum testnet, and each action is recorded on chain for display on the interface. 

Text and links can be shared, and images are planned for release. The platform utilizes IPFS to store content by connecting the user to an IPFS gateway node. 

The Dapp contract uses a series of assets to facilitate interaction between users and transfer value. AETH is held by users and can be sent for payments. Users can then stake their AETH into MANA, which regenerates each day to power voting, posting and commenting on the network. When users burn MANA to vote on content, the creators earns ESSENCE. This received ESSENCE can be transformed back into AETH. MANA takes 7 days to be divested back into AETH, and users require at least 1000 ESSENCE before they can transfer into AETH to redeem their earnings. When users earn ESSENCE, they increase their KARMA, which reduces the mana cost of interaction with the network. 

Pros:
-	Censorship resistant.
-	Strong customizability.
-	IPFS file storage.

Cons:
-	Ethereum network has a slow block time, causing delays in actions on the network. 
-	Users starting out must manually set their own feed structure before any content is shown.
-	Layered complexity in the economic system that may be difficult for new users to understand.
-	Gas costs for creating posts and all transactions.

## 24.12.	Sola [sola.ai]:

Sola is a semi-decentralized social media network that allows users to post cards, containing content, which are then distributed to users, based on recommendations. Users do not have followers, or subscribers. Users can endorse cards by distributing an amount of points, which increment by 5 per click. Posts can be sorted into topics with tags attached to each card. 

Sola uses the SOL ERC20 token to facilitate rewarding users for contributing cards. Mobile users see one card at a time, and either ignore or endorse them. The platform then use machine learning to select cards that are relevant to the users after considering their past choices. 

The moderation on the network is managed by the development team, and plans to monetise through the display of advertising cards, which require promoters to pay in SOL. 18% of the SOL token supply is issued to content creators over time. The network plans to use IPFS for file hosting and user operated nodes in later stages to further decentralize the infrastructure. 

Pros:
-	Content shown as cards.
-	SOL content rewards.
-	Content promotion model based with SOL tokens. 

Cons:
-	No ability to follow users.
-	Content reward distribution is centralized.
-	Content sorting algorithm cannot be customized or changed, all recommended sort.

Users can participate in many to many broadcasts with low latency, as the network uses a set of media servers to relay the stream to users and between each other. Users are able to create virtual environments for sharing videos, with spaces, groups, rooms and stages for separation between public and private sharing. 

The amount of Props earned by creators is determined by the likes and watch time of their videos. The platform uses an additional Coin token to represent fiat purchases and allow mainstream users to make in app purchases of virtual goods. The proceeds from virtual good sales and tipping fees are used to buy PROPS from the market to reward users. Additional PROPS are distributed by the foundation to application developers to incentivise adoption and reward engagement. 

Advertising network are facilitated by the PROPS ecosystem, as platforms with an advertising business model can easily distribute PROPS to their users wallets, using the proceeds of their fiat income streams. Users are incentivised to hold PROPS to access premium content, have increased vote weighting, and promote their content to other users on the network by paying their application. 

Application developers are able to earn partner rewards when they stake PROPS, in proportion to the amount that they stake, paid by the foundation. The stake acts as a bond against malicious actions taken to manipulate the reward distribution system, and aligns economic interests between developers and users that earn PROPS. 

Pros:
-	Multi-party video chat
-	Low video distribution
-	Content rewards 
-	Flexible monetization models depending on application
-	Support from PROPS with developer allocations to fund application rewards.
-	Partner rewards for staking PROPS

# 25.		Potential risks to WeYouMe:

There are several risk cases that have the potential to cause damage to the WeYouMe network and its users. Some of the most prominent are highlighted and mitigated as follows:

## 25.1.		Witness and Miner collusion:

It is possible to consider a scenario in which a majority of the elected witnesses and miners of the WeYouMe blockchain secretly collude and attempt to conduct attacks against the network, including transaction censorship, double spending or transaction alterations. The likelihood of a fraudulent event occurring of this nature is significantly lower than on a purely proof of work or purely delegated proof of stake based block production system. 

WeYouMe uses a hybrid of alternating POW and DPOS block production to ensure that the network cannot be taken over by controlling the network stake or by controlling the majority of mining hardware. The consensus of a majority of both miners and witnesses is required to enact protocol changes. This balances the control over block production between two bodies of participants. Changes must be in the long term economic interests of invested miners and in the interests of users, as represented by elected witnesses. Miners must expend electricity to maintain an attack, and witnesses must be supported by a large stake to maintain an attack. This protects the network by requiring simultaneously that an attacker waste both Capital expenditure and Operational expenditure. 

Both witnesses and miners cannot produce on top of their own blocks, making 51% attacks very difficult, and requires collaboration between multiple parties. Once a block has been validated and committed by two thirds of the miners and witnesses, nodes will not switch to a new blockchain, ensuring fast transaction finality without sacrificing decentralization, and ensures that the network is thermodynamically secure against blockchain rewrite attacks and double spending.

Malicious witnesses can rapidly be voted out of the witness pool. The witness pool comprises of 60 different witnesses per round, with 10 being randomly selected. Given that any one of them can be voted out of block production at any time, losing their income stream, it is not in the interest of any witnesses to engage in fraud, due to their innate accountability to the voting power holding members of WeYouMe. Any private conspiracy to commit fraud could be published, eroding voting support for that witness. It is in the interests of WeYouMe witnesses to expose any attempts to commit blockchain attacks, as this will gain them voting support. There is low barrier to entry for new honest witnesses to replace malicious witnesses through popular support.

Any attempts to execute fraudulent block production practices would be opposed by the voting power holders of WeYouMe, as these practices would undoubtedly erode confidence in the WeYouMe network and are entirely against the interests of the network stakeholders. Such witnesses can and should be immediately devoted from block production. This includes all acts of transaction censorship, coercing direct fees from transaction creators to pay witnesses, any acts that violate the immutability of the blockchain, redistribution of funds, compromising the fungibility of WeYouMe cryptocurrencies, account banning, accepting double spending transactions, accepting invalid transactions, or transactions that are not signed by their creators. 

## 25.2.		Excessive MeCredit issuance:

The MeCredit mechanism is designed to enable the executive board to responsibly issue debt against the revenue of the WeYouMe network. All MeCredit creations must be publicly justified, and approved by 51% of the WeYouMe network voting power. This ensures the consent of the network, and strong oversight of all MeCredit issuance. 

WeYouMe executive are paid using MeCredit, which ensure that any devaluation they cause only undermines their own salaries. If the value of MeCredit falls below $0.90 USD, all executive board members are ineligible for re-election. As a final failsafe against abuse, MeCredit issuance is frozen if its value falls below $0.80 USD to prevent excessive debt load. Through these measures, the issuance of MeCredit is difficult to abuse by malicious executives.

WeYouMe’s debt supply must be carefully balanced to ensure that public has full confidence in the ability for the network to repay its debts out of revenue, and that it pays an adequate rate of interest to ensure a supply of willing creditors. MeCredit is a debt instrument of the WeYouMe network, and is a fiat currency. As such, it should not be held by users that are not confident in the credit of the WeYouMe network, or used as a medium of exchange. Unlike government based fiat currencies, MeCredit is not supported by coercive taxation, but by voluntary purchases of membership, post promotion, and fees for network services. 

## 25.3.		Hostile majority ownership of voting power:

A 51% attack executed on the WeYouMe network would consist of purchasing from the market an amount of WYM and MePower such that the account holds a majority share of the voting power of the blockchain, and is able to decide the outcome of network elections. This attack would enable the account holder the ability to elect the executive board, approve WeYouMe sponsored businesses, and approve any issuance of MeCredit. 

This attack would be incredibly expensive, and would require that 51% of the network voluntarily sell their WYM and MeCoin to a single user or business. Such a scenario is equivalent to a hostile takeover of a publicly traded company, and cannot be feasibly or fairly stopped on a decentralized network. It is up to users to remain vigilant and ensure that a single person does not come to control a majority stake in WeYouMe by holding on to the equity that they own, and not selling it when a large stake is held by a single account or person. 

Given that the majority voter holds a large supply of WYM, which is expensive to acquire, and is valued only when the network is profitable and fully operational to all users, the voter has an incentive to continue operating it at full capacity to earn maximum income. Any attacks against the stability or viability of the network cause massive losses to their own holdings. 

## 25.4.		Critical software bugs:

WeYouMe, like all websites and applications, is vulnerable to critical software bugs. Node software will be tested for at least 3 months before deployment to the mainnet. The WeYouMe Chief Technology Officer is tasked with overall responsibility for ensuring that production code is examined for quality assurance testing, and the Chief Development Officer is responsible for releasing code to witnesses for adoption, and should conduct independent quality testing on all code releases. WeYouMe will have a bug bounty program and a secure vulnerability disclosure channel for bugs to be reported to developers responsibly. 

If a critical bug is found in WeYouMe’s software, all witnesses are advised to revert back to the last stable version of the WeYouMe protocol. A majority of witnesses must also accept newly developed software for a new protocol version to be adopted, and should not upgrade if bugs are present in the codebase. Network voters should support witnesses and developers that conduct further quality assurance testing of any changes to the WeYouMe protocol to ensure that code is bug free. There are many people that any software bugs would have to elude in order for them to cause significant damage to the WeYouMe network, and all network officers and executives should remain vigilant to prevent this scenario.

## 25.5.		Encryption algorithms or private key breach:

In the event that the encryption algorithms used to secure files stored in the Supernode network are breached, then it may become computationally feasible to decrypt stored files without possessing the required private keys. This scenario is highly unlikely, and any breach of the major cryptographic algorithms that WeYouMe will use, such as RSA, will cause major problems for the security of the entire internet. In the event of a major breach of encryption algorithms, the network will hard-fork to a new encryption algorithm. 

WeYouMe’s data is stored in a sharded state across a decentralized network of Supernodes, making it unfeasible for any one of them to read complete files, even if their encryption is broken. This additionally prevents data from being extracted wholesale from a server pertaining to large amounts of user information. No Supernode will hold complete copies of any file, and Supernodes will not distribute private encrypted files to nodes that are not included on the file’s visibility list, as determined by the user. 

Other potential attacks include unauthorized transmittance of connection private keys between accounts that are not approved by the user. Such a breach would require that a connection manually extract an account’s connection private key from their data storage. This would not be possible from any WeYouMe supported applications or www.weyoume.io, but could be made possible by third party applications. 

For this reason, users should not under any circumstances connect to an account that they do not trust with their connection private key. WeYouMe offers 3 separate levels of visibility restriction for increasing amounts of privacy and key isolation. More trusted accounts are connected to with more exclusive private keys, such as friend keys, and companion keys. These should be used for sensitive information, and can shared with trusted accounts, owned by people that are physically known to the user. Sharing these keys requires that the requesting account deposit small amounts as an acceptance bond. These deposits also make it expensive for spammers to acquire large amounts of connection private keys as, unlike other social networks, each request is not costless. 

Data posted with restricted visibility, in addition to being encrypted, has a visibility list, which regulates which accounts and nodes that Supernodes are permitted to send the encrypted files to. Supernodes are regularly tested with false requests for files out of permission scope, and are penalized for sending private files. Even if a private connection key is breached, Supernodes will not transmit private files to users not included on this visibility list, leaving attackers with no files to decrypt. 

Users should remember that any sensitive information shared with any connections can always be screen captured and sent to third parties, regardless of any key sharing, encryption algorithm breach or Supernode permission scope breach. Users should only connect with other accounts that they trust to respect their privacy. If any account suspects unauthorized transmission of its private connection keys, they can be changed at any time, and resent to trusted connections.

## 25.6.		Breach of digital signature algorithms:

WeYouMe will use an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to sign transactions, verifying that the transaction was produced, and authorized by the account that claims to be its creator. In the unlikely event that this algorithm is breached, and it becomes computationally feasible to produce valid signatures without possessing the private signing key of the accounts used in the transaction, then it would become possible to extract funds from other accounts without authorization, make unauthorized posts from an account, and access all account functionality without authorization from the account owner. 

This scenario would pose an existential threat to WeYouMe, as well as all cryptocurrencies, and secure information transmission protocols. It is vitally necessary that this event does not occur, and that the WeYouMe developers remain vigilant to rapidly change all WeYouMe codebases to use a secure cryptographic signature algorithm. In the unlikely event that this occurs, it would behove the entire WeYouMe community to assist in the process of upgrading the WeYouMe protocol, and for all nodes to immediately backup the WeYouMe blockchain, cease processing all transactions, and cease all network functionality until the issue is resolved and the network is secure. 

## 25.7.		Breach of Proof of Work hashing algorithms:

The X11 hashing algorithm combines 11 independent secure hashing algorithms to create proofs of work for block miners. If any of these algorithms is compromised, then the other 10 would ensure that the difficulty remains relatively stable. If all 11 are simultaneously compromised, then it would become computationally trivial to calculate proofs of work, and the difficulty would rapidly increase. The blockchain would become vulnerable to being overtaken by new miners without significant investment into mining hardware. 

This could be used to produce blocks that censor transactions or adopt consensus changes without a majority of network support. In this case, the mining algorithm should be altered by the WeYouMe developers as soon as possible to secure the protocol from attacks. The mining algorithm should not be changed for any other reason than a breach in its security. 

## 25.8.		Blocking of WeYouMe websites or apps:

It is possible that Internet service providers could be ordered by national governments to block user access to WeYouMe affiliated websites, and app store gatekeepers could revoke access to mobile app store listing. This course of action would be mitigated in a number of ways: 

-	By offering an open source WeYouMe desktop application for accessing network features.

-	By offering a progressive web app as a substitute for the WeYouMe mobile application on a web domain.

-	By mirroring the www.WeYouMe.io website at a large number of independently owned domains, that are served from a variety of nationally and geographically distributed servers.

-	By utilizing a Virtual Private Network connection to access www.WeYouMe.io.

Since all network content and user data is stored on a global network of independent nodes, it would be exceedingly difficult to bring down the WeYouMe blockchain. All nodes would have to be shut down simultaneously for the network to incur data loss, or be deactivated. This feat would require widespread violation of human rights by an international totalitarian regime. The WeYouMe advocacy officers are tasked with ensuring positive relations between governments and the WeYouMe network. Advocacy officers are advised to vehemently and vocally oppose acts of censorship against WeYouMe network applications or websites, and inspire popular resistance against such policies where they are implemented. 

## 25.9.		Compromise of Executive board members:

The WeYouMe network requires some central management for limited elements of its architecture, and the best suited people for these positions are decided by network elections. The elected members of the WeYouMe executive board hold the power to approve issuance of MeCredit, release official updates to node software, administrate code repositories, manage fiat currency reserves, manage WYM exchange gateway assets, and speak publicly on behalf of the WeYouMe network. Only verified accounts can become members of the WeYouMe executive board, ensuring that the public identity and reputation of the executives is known to the community. It is up to the WeYouMe voting community to research the candidates that they elect to the positions of the executive board. 

It is possible that the WeYouMe users could elect an executive officer that is unsuitable for their position, due to incompetence, or ulterior malicious intent. If this occurs, the Chief Executive Officer of the WeYouMe network can publish an impeachment transaction to elect a new officer. The option chosen by the majority of voters is carried out, and the position becomes open for re-election to a new executive officer if the officer is impeached. 

If the Chief Executive Officer is found to be unsuitable for their position, a vote for impeachment can be created by the consensus of at least 10 elected witness officers and at least two members of the Executive board. In any case where a Chief Executive Officer is impeached, a new Chief Executive Officer is then elected. All witnesses and executives that voted to initiate the impeachment election are ineligible for the position.

Embezzlement of WeYouMe gateway asset reserves would be difficult, due to oversight from the rest of the executive board, and independent auditors. WeYouMe backed gateway assets must hold a 100% reserve backing at all times. All reserve cryptocurrencies will be kept securely in multi-signature cold storage addresses, and all fiat currencies will be kept in bank accounts with full disclosure of balances and transfers, requiring the signing off of at least 3 executive board members for transactions.

Any embezzlement of funds will severely damage the public image of WeYouMe, and as such, users should consider favoring the election of candidates that hold large balances of MePower and MeBonds. Such executives would have more to lose by stealing from WeYouMe than they would have to gain. Voters should take into account the vested interests of its executives when they decide who to vote for, as all holdings in WeYouMe assets are publicly visible.

Overall power to determine the leadership of the network lies with all voting power holding users. It is up to the community to hold its leaders to account. The powers that the executive board members hold are limited, and executive board members can be replaced if they become compromised. 

## 25.10.	Contentious hardfork or Network split:

The WeYouMe protocol will be updated according to the will of the witnesses and the miners. Changes to the protocol will only be made when a supermajority of the network witnesses and miners have supported the change by upgrading their node. After 75% of Witnesses and Miner have changed to a new protocol implementation, all other miners and witnesses will have 14 days to upgrade their node software before the protocol change is enforced. 

All transactions include the header of a recent block, preventing them from being included in chains that do not include that block. www.WeYouMe.io will always publish transactions on the blockchain pertaining to the protocol version supported by the majority of witnesses and miners. 

For a hardfork to cause a separation of the network, a substantial dedicated group of witnesses and miners must specifically oppose a proposed upgrade, or specifically support a proposed upgrade against the majority of the block producers, and launch their own forked blockchain with these new participants that is incompatible with the majority blockchain. Such a forked blockchain will be less effective, as the WeYouMe executive board will not interact with non-consensus chains, making it difficult for the forked community to conduct network elections, or redeem its gateway assets for the reserves held by the WeYouMe executive board. 

A forked minority chain of WeYouMe would face the task of finding a new group of witnesses, miners, and blockchain officers. They would also need to create and redeem their own gateway assets, and new exchange liquidity. They would need a sustainable community to consistently create content, vote on it, and view it on the minority chain, using a new interface. They would need to attract merchants, customers, exchanges, and businesses to accept their version of WeYouMe cryptocurrencies. They would need to assemble a new development team to make code improvements, and essentially rebuild all of the human resources of WeYouMe from scratch. 

It is vital that Network officers have direct incentives to gain the support of users, and receive their compensation directly from the network, rather than some external business or entity. A theoretical “WeYouMe Classic” protocol that has no executive board, cuts out the WYM stakeholder reward, and compensation for elected network officers will need to organically find and compensate community members for performing these functions, while the WeYouMe blockchain will pay highly for these vital services, and attract talented officers. They will also find difficulty competing against the marketing of the majority chain of WeYouMe to attract new users, the advocacy to earn the support and recognition of businesses and governments, and developers to add new features and maintain network security. It is in the interests of the WeYouMe community to offer blockchain level compensation for these roles, to promote the network. 

Reductions to the payment of MeCoin rewards to WYM stakeholders will result in a lower return on investment, and reduce capital inflows. Removal of fees charged on trading and purchases, membership benefits, or post promotion will reduce the amount of network revenue that provides value to MeCoin, and therefore result in recued content reward value overall. 

A community supported viable minority hardfork is unlikely to occur, as the WeYouMe development team will not and cannot ever compromise the immutability of the blockchain, the fungibility of network cryptocurrencies, or engage in transaction censorship. Any critical events that cause large losses of funds by the community, whether the result of a protocol bug or not, will be reimbursed on a case by case basis according to community approval using the MeCredit system, not by using a redistribution hardfork. MeCoin issuance is never directed to a hardcoded or predetermined developer addresses, and all blockchain level compensations are determined with accountability, using stake weighted voting. WeYouMe users are economically compelled to support the majority chain, as it will reward them with the highest content reward values, and grow the fastest. 

WeYouMe has a built in decentralized exchange to diminish the power of exchanges to determine the allocation of currency tickers. Consensus is directed towards the majority chain, where gateway assets are supported.
In previous hardforks on public blockchains, exchanges have wielded undue influence over the course of protocol development by their choices of assigning tickers for trading. This causes undue momentum towards forking chains, as exchanges are incentivized to have a variety of different splintered networks to generate trading volume from speculation. Alternatively, exchanges also have undue influence over which chain is considered the consensus chain, by their ticker allocation choices effecting the value of the underlying coins, and therefore directing mining power distributions in their favour. 

By building the exchange system into the protocol, WeYouMe mitigates the external influence of exchanges. Exchanges additionally are less likely to hold large amounts of WYM on deposit, which they can vote with and exercise influence without the consent of their users. This reduces the likelihood of exchange hacks on user custodial deposits, as users do not need to sacrifice control over their assets and private keys in order to execute trades.

# 26.		Benefits to WeYouMe users:

The most important use cases that WeYouMe provides are in its unique combination of network effects to facilitate interaction across social and economic lines. 

## 26.1.		Fast, free, and borderless transactions:

Transactions using MeCoin and MeUSD are free, allowing users to send money to anyone, anywhere in seconds without a central intermediary. This service outcompetes mainstream cryptocurrencies, international wire transfers, and remittance providers. Transactions only require a WeYouMe account, which can be created for free without permission or restriction. This is a valuable use case to all businesses, and customers, especially individuals without access to banking services. 

## 26.2.		Free and secure user issued cryptoassets:

WeYouMe’s user issued assets allow anyone to create cryptoassets for free. These assets can be securely traded between all WeYouMe accounts, allowing widely available cryptoequities, and credit instruments for businesses. This service outcompetes existing securities exchanges, by allowing rapid, cheap, and permissionless issuance of equity instruments, with the ability to be traded on the decentralized exchange with very low trading fees. This is a valuable use case for all businesses seeking to raise capital, and create an ownership structure without the regulatory barriers and costs of an Initial Public Offering at a mainstream securities or cryptocurrency exchange. 

## 26.3.		Open business management platform:

WeYouMe business accounts offer a suite of features for managing accounting. By having access to a blockchain record of all transactions, receiving sales income, paying employee wages automatically, paying returns to cryptoequity holders automatically, and receiving periodic withdrawal permissions from customers for recurring payments. WeYouMe business accounts cannot be seized, or frozen. All accounting records are securely encrypted, and immutably recorded. This prevents record tampering, and allows businesses to easily publicly disclose their financial activities. Business registration enables a fully functioning multi-signature account for fund control, without the costs or regulatory barriers of government business incorporation, while still facilitating the oversight of a chosen governance address. This is a valuable use case for new businesses seeking a rapid and cost-effective business management platform, without needing to engage with the fiat economy, and for established businesses looking to gain a foothold in the emerging cryptocurrency economy and access new customer and investment bases. 

## 26.4.		Accountability of network leadership:

The WeYouMe blockchain is produced by a combination of elected witnesses and proof of work miners. The network directly compensates elected developers, marketers, and advocates based on network support. The WeYouMe voting power holders elect the board of executives that work as the steering committee of the network. This is a valuable aspect of WeYouMe that benefits all network participants, and provides ongoing stability and growth to the network. It encourages the inflow of talented blockchain officers, rightfully compensates them for their work, and holds them accountable to the users.

## 26.5.		Permissionless content publishing:

Posts made to WeYouMe consist of encrypted files, hosted on Supernodes, linked to by the WeYouMe blockchain. WeYouMe’s media file data is securely stored in a distributed state, such that it cannot be read by the Supernodes holding the data, and no Supernode holds a complete file. Shards of the file are downloaded independently from many different Supernodes simultaneously. Content cannot be removed from servers, as it cannot be isolated for deletion, and each fragment is replicated with high redundancy. WeYouMe posts cannot be demonetized, and always receive all the rewards allocated to them by user votes. This is a valuable use case for all content producers, as freedom of speech is enforced at the protocol level. 

## 26.6.		Distributed file hosting:

Files can be stored on the Supernode network for private use by their uploading account, within a limit according to storage allocation. Supernode receive rewards for serving files to users, based on their bandwidth contribution, and the voting power of the user. There are no barriers to entry for Supernode file hosts to provide storage and resources to the network. Competition between Supernodes will drive up the amount of storage and processing available for the same network stake. Files are not stored with a centralized file host that can be hacked, and files leaked. They are encrypted, and sharded across the network with strong redundancy. This is a valuable use case for all cloud storage users, as Supernodes are likely to provide more competitive prices, offer greater file transfer speeds, and better data security.

## 26.7.		Encrypted social media:

WeYouMe’s connection encryption keys allow encrypted posts to be accessible to selected groups of accounts that the user trusts. This ensures that only accounts that possess the private key for the level of restriction can access the post. Private posts are not decryptable by Supernode operators, and they do not hold complete files, only shards. This ensures that sensitive information cannot be intercepted, collected, or compromised. Centralized platforms make all data available to the server operators, where it can be leaked, hacked, accessed via backdoors, altered without permission, and used to fuel invasive advertising targeting models. WeYouMe’s promoted posts only utilize public information about what the user is currently viewing, and public account information on the blockchain to determine promotion targeting. 

## 26.8.		Integrated decentralized exchange:

WeYouMe asset holders will be able to securely and inexpensively trade their assets using the decentralized exchange, with all operations recorded on the blockchain. This reduces the need for external centralized exchanges to process trading volume. Users will be able to deposit existing fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies of their choice to fund their WeYouMe account, without having to create an additional exchange account. Users can be confident that funds on the decentralized exchange are controlled only by them, and all gateway assets have publicly available full reserves, that are regularly audited and held in cold storage.

## 26.9.		MeCoin burn mechanisms:

The WeYouMe network cryptocurrencies provide an intrinsic value to users through services provided by promoted posts, and blockchain membership. These services drive demand for MeCoin to be bought and destroyed as payment, and provide value beyond speculative flows. This provides profit inflows and liquidity to holders of WYM and MeCoin, and counteracts the inflation of MeCoin utilized to reward content creators, Supernodes, and block producers. 

## 26.10.	Escrowed and mediated marketplace:

WeYouMe’s marketplace provides a full suite of services to merchants and customers to ensure a strong standard of transaction security. Merchants can use  the public blockchain to feature their product listings easily on external applications by pulling data from APIs. The WeYouMe marketplace can act as a permissionless payment processing backend with lower fees than fiat payment processors. This is a valuable use case for all online businesses that currently pay significant fees to payment processors, and have to list product inventories across multiple sites independently. Products cannot be delisted, and accounts cannot be frozen. The WeYouMe marketplace can accept any cryptocurrency, by receiving deposits from customers and automatically trading them for MeCoin to pay for products. 

# 27.		Conclusion:

WeYouMe presents a comprehensive platform for a cryptocurrency based economy. WeYouMe provides strong advancements over Steem as a social media platform, and over Bitshares as a decentralized exchange.

It improves upon Steem as a social network by compensating views as well as votes, and by returning to a non-linear content reward distribution algorithm. This is critical to correctly valuing a post’s quality and importance to promoters. It enables the creation of distinct and independent moderated boards for communities to grow, and allows posts to be made privately that can only be decrypted by connected accounts. Creators can improve the quality of comment responses by requiring a small micropayment to participate, and can sell premium and subscription content for additional monetization at the high end. By incorporating governance accounts, WeYouMe allows users to direct the extent of content filtering for an optimal user experience, without placing control in a central overseer, and distributing the massive task of content moderation over the entire network such that it is neutral and protects freedom of speech.

It improves upon Bitshares as a decentralized exchange by providing free user issued assets, option assets, automatic asset revenue distribution, and peer to peer lending for margin trading. It enables liquidity pools for asynchronous market making, and charges no fees for maker orders to drive further liquidity. It enables voting by cryptoequity holders to determine enforceable outcomes on multi-signature business accounts with administrative elections, and increases the ability for asset issuers to have finetuned control over their asset properties by offering more permission customization options.  

WeYouMe takes unprecedented measures to reward community developers, marketers, advocates, and community moderators for their efforts. WeYouMe’s guiding executive board is elected by network stakeholders on its blockchain. WeYouMe compensates data hosting nodes, and allows all network data storage to be encrypted and distributed. By enabling users to earn MeCoin for their work, rather than requiring them to purchase some from an exchange, WeYouMe reduces the barrier to entry to the cryptocurrency world to zero. By combining all necessary elements of a digital economy, such as governance, media distribution, data hosting, marketplace trading, and community formation into a single platform, WeYouMe offers significant benefits to its users, and a compelling case for mainstream viability.
